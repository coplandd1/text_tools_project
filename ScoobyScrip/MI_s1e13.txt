EXT. Destroido Corp. - Night
[An employee exits the factory and goes to his car in the parking lot.]
Kelsepsian: [receives call, answers] On my way home, darling. 
[An ominous voice is heard on the other end of the phone.]
Voice: You did not heed my warning.
Kelsepsian: Honey? What's wrong with your voice? It's so deep. Wait a minute, is this that nut again?
Voice: I told you, if you do not quit your job at Destroido and leave forever, something terrible will happen to you. 
Kelsepsian: And I told you I don't appreciate prank calls! My sister-in-law is a paralegal, and if this keeps up, I'm suing you! Go suck a lemon! [hangs up] Oh, boy, the nerve of some people!
EXT. Road - Night
[Kelsepsian drives on the road. He stops at an intersection, but a cicada appears on his windshield.]
Kelsepsian: Ew. One of those cicada thingies. I hate those bugs. Bleugh! [uses windshield wiper]
[The light turns green and he goes ahead, but more bugs appear. Eventually, a large swarm surrounds the car. Some enter the car.]
Kelsepsian: What's goin' on?! Hey! Go away! Come on! Shoo, shoo! Aah! Aah! Oh! I GIVE UP!!!!
[Incapacitated by the bugs, he misses a turn and drives off the edge of a cliff screaming, landing hard below. The cicadas join to form a much larger cicada.]
Cicada Creature: I warned you!
[Intro sequence and title card]
INT. Crystal Cove High School Biology Classroom - Day
[Professor Rick Yantz teaches a biology class, where a cicada sits on his fingertip.]
Yantz: The cicada, the most perfect insect in a decidedly-imperfect world. [kisses cicada, returns it to tree]
[Fred and Daphne are seated.]
Fred: [to Daphne] Did he just kiss a bug?
Daphne: Yeah. Isn't he just the best?
Yantz: The cicada's life cycle is fascinating. As grubs, they burrow into the ground, where they spend the next seventeen years. 
[Shaggy and Scooby are also in class, eating Nature Slivers.]
Scooby: [taps Velma's shoulder] Want one?
Velma: Not from you, I don't.
Scooby: [whimpers] Can't we just be friends?
Velma: Ask me in seventeen years. 
Yantz: Changes in our ecosystem, though, could wipe off the precious cicada, which is why we need to keep watch on companies who pollute nature. Isn't that right, Shaggy and Scooby?
Scooby: Huh?
Shaggy: Pardon?
Yantz: Are you aware that Grandma Moonbeam's Nature Slivers are manufactured by Destroido, and every bite you take supports the biggest polluter in Crystal Cove?!
Shaggy: No, they're, like, super-good!
Scooby: Yeah! Want one?
Yantz: I don't even know why I let you take this class. 
[The bell rings.]
INT. Hallway - Day
[They exit the classroom.]
Fred: That guy's a total nut. 
Daphne: Hm, I think Dr. Yantz is amazing.
Fred: What? What are you talkin' about? 
Daphne: Well, for one thing, he's... he's intelligent.
Velma: And cute. 
Fred: Yeah?! Well, I'd wonder how cute he'd look caught in one of my traps! A real mean one!
Shaggy: Like, are you okay, Freddy?
Fred: Of course, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be okay?
Shaggy: I dunno, you just seem a little, um...
Scooby: Jealous. 
Fred: What?! What are you talkin' about? Jealous? I'm not jealous. 
Shaggy: Okay, whatever you- [feels something in mouth while eating Nature Slivers, pulls it out] oh...
[Shaggy finds a note.]
Shaggy: It's a note from Mr. E! Must have been the back of my Nature Slivers. He says, "There's a mystery waiting for us at the hospital." There's been some sort of weird accident!
Fred: [takes note] What kind of accident?
Shaggy: [burps out another note, reads] He says we'll find out when we get there.
EXT. Hospital - Day
[Mystery Inc. arrives at the hospital. A police car is parked there.]
Velma: Looks like Mr. E's right. Something's up. That's Sheriff Stone's car.
Shaggy: Like, maybe we can stop by the cafeteria when we're done and get some of that delicious hospital gelatin. 
Scooby: Reah! With saltines, and applesauce... 
Shaggy: And gelatin. [exits with Scooby]
[All start walking except Fred.]
Fred: Oh, uh... hey, Daphne.
Daphne: Yes?
Fred: Uh... right, well, I was just wondering if maybe, you know, you'd like to, uh... go on a... duh... duh... d-d-
Daphne: A date? A real date? A date-date?
Fred: Yeah! You and me. There's a new trap exhibit at the museum. 
Daphne: Ugh, traps. Gee, Fred. When you said you wanted to take me on a date, for a minute, I thought you meant it.
Fred: I do mean it! You love traps!
Daphne: No, Fred. You love traps. [walks away]
Fred: Uh...
INT. Operation Room - Day
[A nurse operates on Kelsepsian.]
Nurse: Steady now...
[The nurse removes a cicada lodged in Kelsepsian's nose.]
Nurse: There. 
[The cicada flies away and onto the Sheriff's shirt.]
Sheriff: [screams] Ew! It's on me! [attempts to knock cicada away with hat] Get it off, get off! Get off, get off, oh! 
Mayor: Calm down. It's just a bug.
Sheriff: [screams] Help!
[The mayor knocks the cicada away with his hand.]
Sheriff: Ew, ew, ew! [shudders] Thank you. Ick.
Fred: [enters with Mystery Inc.] Dad?
Mayor: Oh, no.
[The sheriff closes the operation room door to prevent Mystery Inc. from looking inside.]
Fred: Can we help you with anything?
Mayor: No. Go away. 
Velma: Who's the patient?
Mayor: An employee at Destroido. Go away.
Shaggy: Like, what happened to him?
Mayor: It's classified. Go away.
Sheriff: It was this awful creature made of thousands and thousands of cicada bugs! It got in his hair, his nose, all over him! [shudders] Ew, ew! Gross! Ick.
Mayor: What are you, three years old?! All right, fine, yes. A bug creature, okay? And I'm not gonna let a golden opportunity like this go to waste. I already talked with the city council. We're gonna have a Cicada Bug Creature Festival this weekend. The crowds will be huge! And if you have any human decency left in your hearts, you will not get involved!
[The mayor and sheriff exit.]
Fred: Sorry, dad, but we can't do that. 
INT. Dederdee's House - Night
[Another Destroido employee, Hugh Dederdee, showers in his house's bathroom, humming to himself. The phone rings.]
[Hugh Dederdee turns off the shower, ties a towel around his waist and answers the call.]
Hugh Dederdee: Hello?
Voice: You did not heed my warning. 
Hugh Dederdee: You again? I'm taking a shower. Stop calling me!
Voice: I told you. If you do not quit your job at Destroido and leave town forever, something terrible will happen!
Hugh Dederdee: Blah, blah, blah. Leave me alone! [hangs up, returns to shower]
[Hugh Dederdee turns on the shower again, but the water does not come out. Hugh Dederdee examines the shower head.]
[While Hugh Dederdee looks up, a cicada appears out of the drain beneath him.]
Hugh Dederdee: Wha? [bends down] What is that? [picks up bug] A bug?
[Suddenly, cicadas flood out the drain into the shower, screaming, Hugh Dederdee tries to get out of the shower, only to find that the door would not open, the cicadas then surround and attack Hugh Dederdee.]
INT. Hospital - Day
[A Nature Slivers commercial is shown on television in the visitors' waiting room.]
Commercial jingle: [sings] From fields and rivers come Nature Slivers, fish oil, flax, and wheat, Grandma Moonbeam cooks in her kitchen to give you good things to eat. Nature Slivers!
Commercial announcer: When you want fish oil, flax, and wheat in one crunchy bite, bite Nature Slivers! A division of Destroido.
Scooby: [whimpers] I wanna bite some Nature Slivers. I'm starving!
Shaggy: Like, me, too.
Fred: Okay, gang. I got it. Room 24B.
[Inside the hospital room, Dederdee is lying on his bed.]
Grandma Moonbeam: There, there, poor dear. Such an ordeal. 
Daphne: [enters with Mystery Inc.] Mr. Dederdee, mind if we ask you a few questions?
Velma: We heard about your bug attack last night.
Hugh Dederdee: Come on in. I'm not going anywhere. 
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, I should go. Feel better, dear. [reveals herself to Mystery Inc.]
Mystery Inc.: Huh?!
Shaggy and Scooby: Grandma Moonbeam?!
Shaggy: [laughs, shakes Moonbeam's hand] We're, like, your biggest fans!
Scooby: Nature Slivers! Yummy!
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, now, isn't that nice. After I sold my company to Destroido, Hugh here has been instrumental in making them so popular among young people. 
Fred: You work at Destroido, too?
Hugh Dederdee: Mm-hm. 
Velma: Just like the other victim.
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, I'll leave you all to talk. [leaves]
Fred: Mr. Dederdee, do you have any idea why you were attacked?
Hugh Dederdee: Not really. Got a call a couple of weeks ago. Some deep-voiced creepy guy said if I didn't quit my job at Destroido, something terrible would happen to me. I never thought it would be... [shudders]
[As Hugh Dederdee speaks, his EKG monitor starts to get louder, indicating a faster heart rate.]
Hugh Dederdee: Eugh. Disgusting... [frantically scratches himself] bugs... bugs... bugs, all over me! Bugs, buzzing bugs, all over me! [screams]
[A flatline noise is heard. Mystery Inc. exits.]
Daphne: Uh, thanks again, Mr. Dederdee. 
Intercom: Code Blue. Crash cart in Room 613. 
[Nurses rush in. As Mystery Inc. leaves, defibrillator noises are heard.]
Fred: Great question-and-answer session, eh, gang?
[They enter an elevator. The button panel starts to crackle electricity.]
Fred: Uh, hit lobby, will you, Shag? 
[Shaggy hits the button and the elevator door closes. As the elevator descends, Scooby smiles at Velma.]
Velma: Hmph.
[The elevator opens, but they are not on the ground floor.]
Velma: Nice one, dog-boy. You pressed the wrong button. This is the basement.
Shaggy: No, I didn't. Like, see? Lobby. 
Scooby: Hm, must be broken. 
[Fred and Daphne exit the elevator. Fred hits a light switch, turning on some lights. Suddenly, the elevator door shuts behind them. Shaggy attempts to reopen them, grunting.]
[They hear a noise coming from the pipes. Suddenly, the vents open, and cicadas flood in.]
Scooby: [screams, runs around] Bugs!
[The cicadas form a cicada creature.]
Cicada Creature: Cease your useless investigations, or something terrible will happen to you, tomorrow night! Heed my warning. Heed it! Heed! [returns into pipes]
[The elevator door opens again.]
EXT. Street - Night
[Fred drives the Mystery Machine.]
Velma: There has to be some reason the victims all work for Destroido.
[Scooby coughs out a cicada. Daphne screams as it exits the vehicle.]
Shaggy: Like, maybe whosever behind it doesn't like the company.
Daphne: But who could train thousands of bugs to attack like that?
Fred: [brakes hard] Same person who kisses them!
Daphne: What?
Fred: Dr. Yantz! It all fits! Remember what he said in class about Destroido being one of the biggest polluters in Crystal Cove? He hates that company!
Daphne: It's not Dr. Yantz. 
Velma: Wait a minute, Daphne. Fred might be onto something. Dr. Yantz is an expert on cicada. He could have trained them to-
Daphne: It's not Dr. Yantz!
Fred: How do you know?
Daphne: Because... because... because... 
Fred: Because he's cute? I see the way you look at him. Did he give you his phone number? You probably already texted him!
Daphne: What if I did? And what if we made plans to go to the trap exhibit, without you?!
Fred: Wha?! [stutters] We're gonna settle this right now! [drives away]
INT. Crystal Cove High School - Night
[Mystery Inc. stands in the hallway. Fred peeks into Yantz's classroom. He is playing the sitar to the cicadas.]
Scooby: Is he back in there?
Fred: [whispers] Yeah. [pushes Scooby away from view, closes door] Let's go.
Daphne: You're making a big mistake, Fred.
Fred: Big mistakes is what I do. 
[They sneak inside.]
Yantz: [sings] Oh, when you're friends, what will you do, when the ground you call your home is filled with poo? [???]
Fred: The jig is up, Dr. Yantz! Watch out for his weapon, gang. No doubt he's got the cicada under some sort of brain control!
Yantz: I was putting them to sleep. It's their bedtime.
Shaggy: Huh, that's a good one. Right, Scooby-Doo? Huh?
[Scooby is sleeping on the floor.]
Yantz: What is going on here?
Fred: You know exactly what's going on, girlfriend-stealer! 
Daphne: [listens from outside, gasps] Girlfriend? Really?!
Velma: You've been using cicada bugs to attack employees at Destroido.
Yantz: Are you insane? I'm callin' the police.
[Scene cuts. The sheriff and mayor listen to Mystery Inc. talking over each other.]
Mayor: Quiet! Now, one at a time. 
Fred: Dr. Yantz is the cicada creature, dad!
Sheriff: You are? Ohhh.
Mayor: Let's not jump to conclusions. [whispers to Yantz] But if you are the cicada creature, would you mind showing up at the Cicada Festival tomorrow? It'll be a big help.
Yantz: I am not the cicada creature!
Mayor: Of course, you're not! [whispers] Show up around six. I'll have a photographer there.
Yantz: If you don't get these kids out of here right now, I'm pressing charges. 
[They all exit the classroom except Yantz, who slams the door.]
Fred: But, dad, we have to find out who the creature is, and fast!
Mayor: Why? So you can ruin everything?
Daphne: No, because it said it was going to attack us tomorrow night.
Mayor: Tomorrow night? That's wonderful!
All: What?!
Mayor: I mean, terrible. Awful. Fortunately, I know what to do. Come to the Cicada Festival tomorrow night so we can... protect you! Six o'clock. [whispers to sheriff] Let's hire another photographer. This is perfect! [to all] Well, now. Who wants to go out for cheesecake?
EXT. Golf Course - Sunset
[Ed Machine, CEO of Destroido, plays golf with a caddy.]
Caddy: [drives cart] Ed, come on, now. Let's go back to the clubhouse. It's getting dark.
Ed Machine: Forget it. I'm having the best game of my life!
[The caddy sighs and drives away.]
[Ed Machine receives a call and answers it.]
Voice: You did not heed my warning. I told you that you-
Ed Machine: Yeah, yeah, quit my job at Destroido or some'in' terrible would happen to me. Listen, you. I'm the CEO of the company, and I am not going anywhere! Now, get lost! [hangs up]
[Ed Machine hits the ball into the hole.]
Ed Machine: That's the way to do it. 
[The ball mysteriously flies out of the hole.]
Ed Machine: Huh?
[The flag flies out of the hole.]
Ed Machine: What? [inspects hole]
[Cicadas fly out of the hole. They swarm Ed Machine and form the larger cicada creature.]
INT. K-Ghoul - Day
Velma: [reads newspaper] Looks like that cicada thing struck again last night!
Shaggy: And, like, we're next. Tonight! [whimpers]
Fred: Hey, don't worry. I've got it all figured out. I was up all night building a trap, and believe me, I'll catch it.
Scooby: Or die trying.


INT. Trap Exhibit - Night
Fred: Thanks again, Daph, for agreeing to come here.
Daphne: Oh, Freddy. I wanted to, for you. So, uh, how long do you think we'll be stuck in this trap?
[They are both stuck in a trap, with Fred being upside down.]
Fred: Well, the cleaning crew usually gets in around nine, so it should only be... twelve hours or so. Hey, can I have a sip of your soda? My throat's starting to close up from the blood rushing to my head. 
[Daphne reaches to give Fred the drink, but he spills it over himself.]
Daphne: Oh, Freddy.
