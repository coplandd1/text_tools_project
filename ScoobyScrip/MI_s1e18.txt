INT. Macau Jewelry Store - Night
[A woman enters a jewelry store in Macau.]
Jeweler: May I help you?
Girl: Do you have any jewelry? You know, like rings and stuff? [shows panda ring]
Jeweler: Of course. Right this way. [walks to ring displays]
Girl: Ooh, let me see that one!
Jeweler: I'm not supposed to show that to anyone.
Girl: [flirtatiously] Not even me?
Jeweler: I guess it wouldn't hurt to let you look. [takes out ring from glass case]
[The girl gasps as she sees the ring.]
Girl: How much?
Jeweler: I'm afraid it's not for sale. I'm just holding it for a customer. 
[The phone rings. The jeweler answers the phone while the girl returns the ring box.]
Jeweler: [into phone] Tsiu Chow's Trading Post, Ray speaking. 
Girl: Well, thanks anyway. [leaves]
Jeweler: Look, just tie it down until I get home.
[An unseen figure enters the store.]
Jeweler: [sees man, gasps] I'm... gonna have to call you back. [hangs up]
Man: I've come for my ring.
Jeweler: Of course. [hands ring box]
Man: [opens ring box] What is this? [shows ring box]
[The jeweler looks at the ring box. His priceless ring has been replaced by the girl's panda ring.]
Jeweler: I don't understand! It was just here!
[The man starts to summon electricity in his hands, preparing to attack the jeweler.]
Jeweler: But I... I... no! Please! 
[The man grabs the jeweler by the neck. The jeweler screams as the man attacks him with electricity. Outside, the girl looks at the ring she stole.]

INT. Chen's Coffee - Day
[Shaggy stands at the counter to order food.]
Shaggy: Like, I'll take a double-bacon latte, dry, no whip with a triple puff of nacho cheese! [chuckles] Can you make that?
Chen: Make it? I invented it.
Daphne: Tonight's the first time my parents will see Fred and me as a couple. I just want everything to be perfect. I'm afraid they think Fred is a weirdo. Thanks for listening.
Scooby: No problem. 
[Velma enters with the girl from Macau.]
Daphne: Velma, over here!
Velma: [to girl] Those are my friends. Watch out for the skinny, frail-looking one.
[Shaggy spills coffee on his nose. The girl watches him amorously.]
Velma: [to Mystery Inc.] This is Mai Le. She's here from China on a two-week student exchange.
Shaggy: Like, who did we exchange for her?
[The girl chuckles.]
Velma: The school's weird girl, Hot Dog Water. 
[A cutaway is shown of Hot Dog Water in China. Hot Dog Water sips some soup.]
Hot Dog Water: Oh, boy. [stomach rumbles] There isn't gluten in these noodles, is there? Probably shoulda told ya. I have a major gluten intolerance.
[End of cutaway]
Daphne: Welcome to Crystal Cove, Mai Le. I think you're gonna love it here. 
Scooby: Me, too!
Mai Le: [to Shaggy] Me, too.
[Chen walks by with the drinks.]
Velma: Chen, this is Mai Le. She's visiting from China. 
Chen: Welcome! Please, try one of my Szechuan pork ice cream sandwiches! On the house! [chuckles]
[Mai Le reaches for a sandwich, but Chen notices the dragon ring on her hand.]
Chen: Uh! Uh... excuse me. [leaves]
Daphne: You know, there's a delegate from China visiting Crystal Cove right now. My boyfriend, Fred - I love saying "boyfriend!" - is showing him around town with his dad. My boyfriend, Fred's, town is the mayor. Boyfriend.
Velma: Daphne's mom and dad are hosting a dinner for him tonight. You should come!
Mai Le: Will there be any cute boys there?
Daphne: Well, Fred, my boyfriend, of course!
Shaggy: Like, ahem!
Daphne: Oh! And Shaggy. 
Mai Le: And I'll be there. For sure. 
Velma: [to Mai Le] Sister, you're playing with fire. 
[Mai Le laughs.]
EXT. Street - Day
[Fred, Mayor Jones, and the Chinese diplomat pose in a photo stand-in.]
Mayor: Mr. Wang, what you guys need is a theme, something that makes your little country stand out. Something that says "fun!" Here in Crystal Cove, our theme is the world's most haunted tourist trap- I mean, town! Folks can't get enough of it.
Fred: Everyone, say "beef and broccoli!"
[The photographer snaps a photo.]
Wang: Fascinating. There is much we can learn from you. 
[Meanwhile, Shaggy walks with Mai Le.]
Mai Le: You've been to China?
Shaggy: No, but my stomach has. Scoob and I get Chinese takeout every single week. 
[They laugh. Velma pulls Shaggy aside.]
Velma: Shaggy, you have to stop flirting with Mai Le. 
Shaggy: Like, dude, I'm just bein' polite. 
Velma: The last time you were that polite to me, I spent a month locked in my bedroom listening to "Now That's What I Call Breakup Songs 16."
Mayor: Mr. Wang, we better get you back to the hotel if you're going to be ready for the shindig tonight. Oh, pardon my French. "Shindig" is American for hootenanny!
Wang: I'm honoured to attend your... "shindig." [notices Mai Le's dragon ring] That is a lovely ring, Miss... 
Mai Le: Le. Mai Le.
Wang: Where did you find such a treasure?
Mai Le: At some junk store.
Daphne: [ushers Mai Le away] Dinner is at eight. Dress is casual.
[Mr. Wang looks at them, scheming.]
INT. Blake Mansion - Night
[Mystery Inc. is seated at the banquet.]
Shaggy: Like, dude, swap seats with me, would ya?
Scooby: Why?
Shaggy: So, um, I could be closer to the, uh, gravy!
Scooby: [passes gravy] Here you go. 
Shaggy: Thanks, but I really want to be closer to the, uh... baked Alaska.
[Scooby passes the baked Alaska.]
Shaggy: Scoob! Just switch seats with me.
Scooby: Fine! Hmph. Testy. 
[Barty Blake rings a cup with a spoon.]
Barty Blake: Mr. Wang, friends, [glares] Fred. I would just like to say- [lights shut off] Who turned out the lights?
[Red lightning appears around the room. In a puff of smoke, a red wizard appears.]
[Commercial break]
[The people run away from the wizard.]
Red wizard: Do not disturb the dragon's heart, or you will pay the price! The Dragon's Heart belongs to no one! Whoever tries to claim it will die!
[Mai Le hides under a table, but the wizard sees her.]
Red wizard: You have unknowingly brought grave danger to all who are near you! [casts lightning at her]
[Shaggy hides with Mai Le, throwing her out of the lightning's way.]
Shaggy: I came down here to protect you, but now I see that I'm paralyzed with fear!
Velma: What is the dragon's heart?
[The red wizard lifts the table.]
Nan Blake: Somebody, do something!
Fred: Way ahead of you, Mrs. Blake. [pulls rope]
[The rope mechanism breaks the head off a statue, which swings and breaks through a wall. This causes a net to lower, almost capturing the red wizard. The wizard disappears, however, and the net instead captures the other guests.]
Mayor: Rumbling swamp-crickets! What just happened?!
Barty Blake: I seem to be trapped in some sort of net. 
Fred: Not just any net! That's a Brownberger B41: titanium-woven, aircraft-grade, aluminum grommets, this baby is shark-proof!
Daphne: But why is it in our dining room?
Fred: I installed it last year for a situation just like this!
Velma: You booby-trapped Daphne's house?
Fred: I booby-trapped all your houses for protection, and it's a good thing I did. We almost caught that wizard!
Nan Blake: Almost?! You destroyed my dining room!
Fred: Hey, you can't trap an omelette without breaking a few eggs, am I right? [pulls rope, lifting net]
Mayor: Mr. Wang, I am so sorry about this.
Barty Blake: Spare me. Things like this always happen when the Jones boys are around.
Mayor: What's that supposed to mean?!
Wang: Thank you for this... memorable evening, but I have had enough excitement for one night. It is time I return to my economy lodging.
Barty Blake: Daphne, I want your idiot boyfriend out of my house!
Fred: Did you hear that? Your dad called me your boyfriend! I think tonight was a big step forward. 
[Daphne growls at Fred.]
Velma: Maybe we should just look for some clues. 
Scooby: Good idea. [sniffs around, sneezes]
Shaggy: What'd you find, Scoob?
Velma: It's some kind of red dust. 
Mai Le: That's not dust. It's tea. Scarlet oolong, to be exact. This tea is very rare. 
[Velma drops it in a candle, but it combusts in a burst of flames.]
Velma: And flammable.
Fred: I only know one place in Crystal Cove that specializes in rare, flammable teas. 
EXT. Chen's Coffee - Night
[Fred watches the coffee shop from the Mystery Machine.]
Fred: It's pretty quiet out there. 
Velma: Fred, when did you install a periscope in the Mystery Machine?
Daphne: Probably right around the time he was installing a trap in my dining room. What else aren't you telling us, Fred?
Fred: Nothing, Daphne, I swear!
Daphne: Whatever. Where's my lip gloss? [presses button on glove compartment]
Fred: Daphne! Wait! No!
[Daphne's seat ejects, launching her out.]
Fred: I guess there was one other thing I didn't tell you. 
Shaggy: The key to a good stake-out is making sure you've got enough snacks. [holds up bag]This is Scoob's and my special snack sack. We've got something from every food group: salty, sugary, jerky, and ice cream!
Scooby: Yeah!
Shaggy: Like, I recommend eating the ice cream first! [passes spoon to Mai Le]
[Shaggy does not pass a spoon to Scooby.]
Scooby: Huh?
[Shaggy and Mai Le start eating. Scooby whimpers.]
Shaggy: Boy, it's delicious.
Velma: I feel your pain, dog.
[Daphne enters, covered in dirt stains.]
Fred: I am so sorry.
Daphne: Save it. 
[Suddenly, white electricity crackles. It lifts the Mystery Machine and shakes it violently.]
Shaggy: Zoinks! Let's get outta here!
[Daphne kicks open the back door.]
Velma: This way!
[They exit and see a white wizard.]
Daphne: It's the wizard from the party!
[The wizard takes the Mystery Machine and throws it at them. They run away, but suddenly, a red wizard appears.]
Fred: No, wait! That's the wizard from the party!
Velma: Two wizards? What is going on?
[The two wizards face each other and begin to battle.]
Shaggy: Like, this would be so cool if I wasn't so terrified!
[The wizards create dragons of lightning and they clash. Velma watches the white wizard's hand via binoculars.]
Velma: That white wizard has three rings exactly like yours!
[The two wizards continue to clash, creating balls of energy which fly in all directions and threaten to hit Mystery Inc. Suddenly, the white wizard gets the upper hand, sending the red wizard flying into a dumpster. The white wizard laughs and turns to Mai Le.]
Scooby: Uh-oh.
Shaggy: Like, I second that, Scoob!
Fred: Quick, everybody! Back to the van.
[They run into the van, but Fred struggles to start it.]
Fred: [turns ignition key] Come on! Come on!
[Suddenly, the white wizard grabs Mai Le by the ankle.]
Mai Le: Help!
Shaggy: [grabs Mai Le's arms] Mai Le!
[The white wizard rips Mai Le out of Shaggy's grasp and tries to get away. Meanwhile, Fred starts the vehicle and chases after them.]
White wizard: Hurry! Give it to me!
Fred: Shaggy, I need your snack sack. [Shaggy gives it to Daphne] Daphne, slide over and put the snack sack on your seat.
Daphne: Okay, ready to launch. [presses button]
[The sack hits the wizard. Then, the Mystery Machine runs into him, causing him to let go of Mai Le. Shaggy catches her.]
Shaggy: Like, we got her!
[The Mystery Machine drives away, but the wizard chases. Meanwhile, the red wizard starts to recover.]
Velma: He's still coming! 
[The red wizard confronts the white wizard. They clash and vanish in a puff of light.]
EXT. Velma's House - Night
[The Mystery Machine parks by Velma's house.]
Velma: Are you okay, Mai Le?
Mai Le: I am now, thanks to Shaggy. I owe you my life. 
Shaggy: It was, you know, like, nothin'.
[Velma looks at Shaggy.]
Shaggy: What? Is there something in my teeth?
[Velma and Mai Le exit the vehicle and get in the house.]
Velma: Come on.
INT. Velma's Bedroom - Night
[Velma enters and turns on the lights.]
Mai Le: So, what's the story with Shaggy? He's cute.
Velma: Stay away from Shaggy. He has dog issues.
Mai Le: I... don't know what that means.
[The lights shut off.]
Velma: Now what?
[The white wizard appears in the window. He cackles.]
[Commercial break]
[The wizard chases Velma and Mai Le down the stairs.]
Velma: Quick, Mai Le, this way!
White wizard: [casts lightning] Give me the ring! It is the key to possessing the Dragon's Heart!
Velma: What are you doing?!
[Mai Le kicks the wizard in the face.]
Velma: Jinkies! You go, girl! 
[The wizard gets up. They fight.]
[Meanwhile, Shaggy uses an English to Chinese dictionary, walking towards Mai Le's house.]
Shaggy: Mei you hong pang jiao la hao lei! [opens door] Mai Le!
[Velma and Mai Le are thrown out of the house.]
Shaggy: Xing shang de gu xi!
[The wizard takes the ring from Mai Le's finger.]
Mai Le: My ring!
[The wizard cackles and disappears.]
Shaggy: That is so not how I imagined this happening.
INT. Chen's Coffee - Night
Velma: I have searched every corner of the internet, and I cannot find anything about the dragon's heart.
Daphne: And why did he steal Mai Le's ring? He already had three of them.
Chen: [enters] The wizard has all four rings? Ai1 jaa1, gaau2 mat1 gwai2 aa5? Zan1 hai bai lah! (loosely translated: "My god, what are you doing? We're in real trouble now!")
Fred: Chen, what do you know about this?
Chen: [sighs] Well, I... I suppose it's time you should know. That red wizard who's been popping up out of nowhere... it's me.
Shaggy and Scooby: What?!
Chen: When I was a young grasshopper in China, I was entrusted with a priceless ruby called the Dragon's Heart. Centuries ago, the ruby was encased in a great jade dragon. Legend has it that you must use four sacred rings to gain access to the Dragon's Heart. 
Shaggy: But, like, now, the white wizard has all four rings.
Velma: If only we had that jade dragon, we could use it to lure him...
Fred and Daphne: Into a trap!
Chen: You're in luck, because the jade dragon is right over there.
All: Oh.
Fred: Gang, it's trappin' time!
INT. Chen's Coffee - Night
[Chen closes the shop and calls out the window to lure the wizard.]
Chen: I sure hope no one notices this window is gone and steals my jade dragon. Oh, well.
[The white wizard appears. Firework rockets launch and explode, triggering fire sprinklers. The water removes the wizard's ability to use lightning.]
White wizard: Huh?
Fred: Scooby Snack, go! [tosses snack to Scooby]
[Scooby catches the snack and lands on a plank, activating the trap. The trap captures the wizard in a ball-shaped contraption.]
Fred: [rips off cover, revealing cage] Ta-da! The Brownberger B41. It's the trapper's trap.
Mayor: [enters, turning on lights] Spicy jiblet ponies, Fred! Why do you have a geisha tied up in here? You know they belong downtown in Crystal Cove's Geisha House of Terror.
Fred: He's not a geisha, dad. He's a wizard. Or at least, that's who he's pretending to be. 
[Velma pulls off the wizard's mask.]
All: Mr. Wang?!
Scooby: Big surprise.
Mayor: What, Wang?! Why?!
Wang: I've searched for the Dragon's Heart all my life. I've tracked it to your silly little town, and it was almost mine! Mine!
Mai Le: You won't be needing these anymore. [removes Wang's rings]
Daphne: Now it all makes sense. Mr. Wang used his supposed "research trip" to Crystal Cove as an excuse to hunt for the Dragon's Heart. [flashback starts] When he saw that Mai Le was wearing the fourth dragon ring, he knew he was close. Mr. Wang posed as the evil white kung-fu wizard to steal the fourth dragon ring from Mai Le, but Chen pretended to be a red wizard in an effort to stop him. 
Velma: After the wizard battle downtown, Mr. Wang came to my house in one last effort to get the ring. [flashback ends]
Shaggy: But how did he make himself fly?
Chen: Oh, the same way I did. [pulls off Wang's robe] Jetpack!
All: Oh! Of course!
Daphne: And the magic lightning bolts?
Velma: [shows Wang's hands] Homemade Tesla coils. Genius!
Wang: It was the perfect plan! That ruby is priceless! I was going to be rich, and I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you-
Fred: [puts mask back on] Save it, Wang. We've heard it all before.
[Scooby giggles.]
EXT. Chen's Coffee - Night
Mai Le: I can't thank you all enough for what you've done for me. Oh, and before I forget, Chen rightfully should have these. [gives rings to Shaggy]
Shaggy: Like, so now that it's over, Mai Le, um, I was wondering if we could, like, you know... um... like... how do I say this?
Scooby: Go on a date?
Shaggy: Right! Thanks, pal!
Mai Le: Oh, Shaggy, I'd love to, but it's time for me to return to China.
Shaggy: China? Like, what do you mean?
[A car arrives to pick Mai Le up.]
Mai Le: In ten minutes. 
[Shaggy whimpers, sadly.]
Mai Le: [gets in car] Goodbye, everyone. I'll never forget you. Especially you, Shaggy.
Shaggy: I guess this is what it feels like to have your heart broken. 
Velma: You know, one of the things I always wanted a boy to do was surprise me and see me off as I was leaving on a plane.
Daphne: Yeah, that is romantic.
Shaggy: But, like, I don't even know what flight she's on.
Velma: It's Crystal Cove, Shaggy. We've only got the one plane.
Fred: [drives Mystery Machine] Come on, gang! I'll drive!
Shaggy: Thanks, guys. And, uh, thanks, Velm.
EXT. Port - Night
[Mai Le sneaks on a ship and sets sail. She takes a box to a room in the ship and opens it, revealing she has the Dragon's Heart ruby.]
Mai Le: Finally, mine. So long, Mystery Incorporated. 
[The ship suddenly jolts. The ruby falls out of Mai Le's hands and lands in Shaggy's.]
Shaggy: Hello, dude. Or should I say... Mai Le? I went to the airport to see you off, but you weren't on the plane. It was always about the ruby, wasn't it? You just used us to get Wang out of the way so you could get the other rings!
Mai Le: That's right. [flashback starts] While you and your idiot friends were explaining Wang's plan, I opened the jade dragon and took the ruby. [flashback ends] The Dragon's Heart belongs to me!
Shaggy: Fine, come and get it!
[Mai Le strikes a table, breaking it in half.]
Shaggy: Zoinks! [runs]
[Mai Le chases Shaggy around the ship deck, but falls into a trap and is suspended upside down.]
Mai Le: Let me go, you idiots!
Scooby: You okay, Shaggy?
Shaggy: Was everything about you a lie? Like, even us?
Mai Le: Sorry, dude.
Velma: He's too good for you, dog issues or no dog issues. 
Mai Le: I still don't know what that means.
Daphne: Mom, dad, you can come out now.
[Daphne's parents appear.]
Fred: Thanks again, Mr. and Mrs. Blake, for letting us disguise your boat as Mai Le's escape boat.
Barty Blake: Well, I have to admit, Fred, your Cochamamy trap actually worked.
Fred: That's awfully nice of you to say, sir.
Daphne: I think Daddy's warming up to you.
Nan Blake: Just one question: how did you know that Mai Le would step right in the middle of your trap?
Fred: I didn't. That's why I set traps all over this boat.
Barty and Nan: You did what?
[Barty and Nan both fall into another trap.]
Barty Blake: Fred Jones, you buffoon!
Daphne: Oh, Freddy.
Scooby: Yeah! [giggles]
[Credits roll]
