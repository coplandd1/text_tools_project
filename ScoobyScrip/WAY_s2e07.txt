[Howling]

[Growling]

Mmm! Those hot dogs are
beginning to smell delicious.

Speaking of dogs,

Where is that original
chowhound of ours?

I've never known him
to be late for a meal.

The laurel and hardy
of the outdoors

Are still trying to
put up scooby's tent.

Ok. Pull!

Oh. What the heck kind of tent

Is this anyway, scoob?

SCOOBY: Pup tent.

Pup tent? I might have known.

Well, let's try again.

There. It looks
real comfortable.

SCOOBY: Mm-hmm.

Now, what did you do that for?

Velma: come and get it, you guys.

Chow time, pal. See you later.

Food?!

Ahh. Yum, yum, yum.

There's nothing I like better than food,

Unless it's more food.

SCOOBY: Yeah. Yeah!

[Howling]

What was that?

L-l-look!

[Growling]

[Scooby yelps]

Shaggy: what was that?

Whatever it was, it's gone now. See?

Velma: it was probably only a wolf.

Shaggy: what do you mean "only"?

Let's take a look.

Let's pretend we already
did and didn't find anything.

SCOOBY: Yeah. Yeah!

Velma: no, shaggy. Let's go look.

Then this calls for some special nerve-soothing nourishment.

Scooby doo!

SCOOBY: Tracks!

Hey! It is tracks!

Good going, scoob.

Velma: judging from
the size, outline,

And general configuration,

I would say they're definitely
the tracks of a large wolf.

But he's gone, so we got
nothing to worry about.

There's only one thing

That bothers me.

What's that?

Wolves are 4-legged animals,

But these were made
by a 2-legged one.

Daphne and fred: a werewolf!

A werewolf!

SCOOBY: [Whimpering]

Here we go with another mystery.

And the only way to solve it

Is to follow those tracks.

Oh, no!

SCOOBY: Oh, no!

I smell trouble, scary trouble.

SCOOBY: Look!

It's an old graveyard.

My very most unfavorite

Place to be,

Especially at night.

That's odd...

A fresh grave in an
old graveyard like this.

Scooby: oh, no!

Let's go see.

Look! The coffin

Is open and empty!

Daphne: it sure looks old.

[Fred reading]

And I'm half-gone already. Bye!

Hey! Come on, shaggy.

This is our first
really sound clue.

Yeah, but it looks like

Our clue is out to dinner.

And look! There are
more wolf tracks

Leading away from the grave.

Oh, swell.

It ain't bad enough we're
following a werewolf.

Now it looks like it's
the ghost of a werewolf.

SCOOBY: Ghost?!

Velma: well,

The tracks clearly
lead into that old mill.

[Werewolf howling]

SCOOBY: [Whining]

Nothing like a cheery greeting

From your friendly

Neighborhood werewolf ghost.

Come on. Let's
take a look inside.

Fred: hey! It's opening!

Daphne: ooh, what a scary place.

Furnished in early werewolf.

Shaggy: don't look like

The cleaning woman's
been by too recently either.

We'll split up. I'll
take the girls this way.

Shaggy: yeah, I know.

And scooby and me
will go the other way.

Ouch!

SCOOBY: Hee hee hee hee hee!

What's so funny?

SCOOBY: Yipe!

Shaggy: yow! It's him...
The ghosty werewolf!

SCOOBY: Gone.

Where did he go so fast?

[Squeaking]

Imagine you getting so scared

Of a tiny little old mouse.

Ridiculous.

SCOOBY: Yeah. Ridiculous.

Anything in that old crate?

SCOOBY: [Sniff sniff] no.

Shaggy: maybe there's
nothing to be scared of

In this old place after all.

Scooby: yeah.

[Growling]

Wonder what's in here.

Nothing here.

SCOOBY: Nothing here.

[Growling]

Sure be a joke if
this werewolf thing

Turned out to be our
imagination after all.

Scooby: yeah.

SCOOBY: What's that?

What's that?

Oh, just some kind of old mask.

What was that?

SCOOBY: Search me.

We haven't found a thing.

Maybe we're on a
wild-goose chase after all.

Fred: could be.

Hold it. Look at that! Tracks!

Fred: that's funny.

The tracks stop at the wall.

But even a werewolf
can't walk through a wall.

Unless he really is a ghost.

I'll bet there's a
secret entrance.

Let's see if we can find out

How to open it.

Uh-oh. Pay dirt.

Velma: good going, freddy.
We found a secret room.

Come on.

What's that paper on the table?

Looks like a map.

Daphne: do you suppose
it's a treasure map?

Not likely. It looks
more like a map

Of the general area around here.

There's 3 xs marked on it.

One says "mill."

Well, at least ghosts
don't need maps, so...

[Growling]

It's the werewolf!

Fred: hold it!

Get ready.

Ok, shove!

[Growling]

Hi, gang.

You'll be glad to
know that scoob and me

Haven't found a
trace of a ghost.

The werewolf!

Scooby: yipes!

[Growling]

Shaggy: feet, make
like a rocket,

And, like, now!

? Hey, girl, you
got me runnin' ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? My heart is lost, and
my mind's gone funny ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Tell me, tell me
where you been hidin' ?

? I took a look, and I decided ?

? Gotta know why
you mystify me ?

? I can't see nothin' but you ?

? All I do ?

? All day through ?

? Is think of you ?

? Ahh ahh ahh ?

? Ahh ahh ahh ?

? Ahh ?

? Hey, girl, you
know you need me ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Open up your eyes and see me ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Tell me, tell me
that we'll make it ?

? If there's a chance,
then I'm gonna take it ?

? Here's my heart, now,
please don't break it ?

? I don't want nothin' but you ?

? There's so much
that I want to say, now ?

? Tell me, tell me it's ok now ?

? Say you love me,
say you'll stay, now ?

? Tell me what to do, ooh ?

? Hey, girl, you
got me runnin' ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? My heart is lost, and
my mind's gone funny ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Hey, girl, you
got me runnin' ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? My heart is lost, and
my mind's gone funny ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Hey, girl, you
know you need me ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

? Open up your eyes and see me ?

? Na na na na na na na ?

Fred: what do you suppose

Happened to shag and scoob

After they fell on
that old waterwheel?

I hope that terrible
werewolf creature

Didn't get them.

Daphne: oh, no!

More ghosts!

Why did they run away?

SCOOBY: I know. Watch.

Oh. They thought we were ghosts.

Ha ha ha ha!

Thanks, pal.

Now, let's go find
where they went.

SCOOBY: Right.

What's that?

Scooby: beats me.

Never saw a barrel

With anything like this

On it before.

SCOOBY: Gulp

Shaggy: uh-oh. Let us go!

Fred: hold it, you two. It's me.

What are you doing in there?

Waiting for the werewolf

To come along. What else?

Well, I'm glad we found you.

What's that in your ears?

Huh?

Oh, wool, I guess.

Me and scooby

Crash-landed in a pile of wool.

So that was you
in the white stuff.

This is curious.

What would wool be doing
in an old abandoned mill?

We've got a lot of strange clues

That don't fit: the wool,

These funny barrels with
rubber tubing, the map.

And that ghostly werewolf.

Yeah. I'd sure like to know

How mr. Creepy-crawly
fits in with all this.

SCOOBY: Me, too.

Let's go find him.

Oh, why don't I just keep quiet?

SCOOBY: Yeah!

Fred: well, it's been
entirely too long

Since we've seen our
friend the werewolf.

He's probably up to something.

[Werewolf howling]

I knew it was too good to last.

Come on, girls.

Let's go see where
that railcar came from.

Don't tell me.

Scoob and me go to see
where it's going, right?

You got it, and be careful.

Now, that's probably the
most unnecessary thing

She'll ever say.

Look! There's that
narrow-gauge rail.

Let's see where it leads to.

This way.

Look!

Daphne: who's that?

Velma: and what's he up to?

Fred: I don't know,
but let's find out.

He's gone!

But where?

There's no other
doors in this place.

[Door slams]

We're locked in!

Let's try that window.

Oh, we're trapped!

But good.

[Werewolf howls]

How about that? A pop-top barge.

SCOOBY: Yeah.

[Growling]


Yow! Yow!

Shaggy: yow! What do we do now?

[Laughing]

[Werewolf growling]

Shaggy: step right in, sir.

No waiting.

Shaggy: I know. Just
a light trim, sir.

We're all wearing it a
bit longer these days.

SCOOBY: Bad nails.

You have a dandruff
problem, too, sir.

[Growling]

Is something wrong, sir?

Scooby, scat!

Well, do we follow this tunnel

Or go back up
there and face him?

SCOOBY: Uh-uh!

No telling where
this'll lead us.

Sure would like to
know what this thing is.

I'd rather know

How we're going
to get out of here.

Shh. Listen. What's that?

[Knocking]

Look!

Well, well. Dr. Livingston
and friends, I presume.

But how could these railcars

Just simply disappear

Into that old barge, shaggy?

Yeah, and what do you mean

The deckhouse tips
up and they go inside?

But they do!

You're talking in riddles.

Hold it. Hold it!
It will be easier

To show you than to tell you.

SCOOBY: You mean...

Yeah. We got to go back

Through the tunnel, scoob.

You know how
freddy and velma are

When they got a
mystery to unsolve.

SCOOBY: Oh, no!

Shaggy: now, watch.

Fred: run!

Least we know
where the barrels are.

Fred: if we only knew why.

Velma: look! It's him!

Daphne: what in the world?

Velma: he's pulling a
barrel out of the water.

[Sheep bleating]

I hear sheep.

SCOOBY: Me, too.

[Sheep bleating]

Velma: you certainly do,

And I think I'm beginning
to get the picture,

Right, freddy?

Right, but we'll have to
capture that werewolf

To prove it.

Do what?

Capture him?

Fred: I've got a plan.
Now, listen closely.

I don't know why I
let you and freddy

Talk me into this crazy idea.

SCOOBY: Me?

Nutty notion...

Us distracting that
werewolf's attention

So's they can capture him.

Shall we cast off, skipper?

SCOOBY: Anchors aweigh!

At least we know what
this tube is for now.

It's for air.

Let's make sure
we all understand.

When shag and scoob
distract the werewolf,

We snag him with
this crane and hook.

Then it's up, up, and away

For the old werewolf,
and we got him.

Here comes shag and
scoob's barrel now.

Fred: that's them!

You gals get up on the
deckhouse and give me directions.

Right! Right!

Ok. Get ready.

Surprise!

Freddy, let the hook go!

Fred: stand clear!

Daphne: help! Help!

Freddy, come quick!

Yow!

Grab her!

Yow!

[Growling]

Hey, scoob, let's take
the scenic river route

Out of here.

? Row, row, row your boat ?

SCOOBY: I am. I am!

Hold still,

And we'll get you unhooked.

I'd trade most anything

For a good, fast
motor right now.

SCOOBY: Except me?

Right. Anything except you, pal.

Keep paddling.

Hey, no hitchhikers.

SCOOBY: [Whimpering]

Sorry, chum, but we got
enough trouble without you.

Go bother someone else.

SCOOBY: Uh-oh. Look!

He's gaining, scoob!
Pour on the steam!

SCOOBY: I am! I am!

We've got to help them
before it's too late!

But what can we do?

I've got an idea.
Come on. Hurry!

SCOOBY: [Whimpering]

SCOOBY: Look!

What's the matter?

Yipes! Let's play a
little water hopscotch.

Give a big jump!

SCOOBY: Ok.

[Growling]

Ha ha ha!

SCOOBY: Oh, no!

Yipes! And double yipes!

Help!

Look what we caught...
And without any bait.

Never thought I'd
be glad to be a fish.

SCOOBY: Me, too. Whew!

Man: help!

Who could that be?

Help! Help!

It's the werewolf!

Help! Save me!

He sure doesn't sound much
like a werewolf anymore.

Well, let's fish him out, too.

We sure thank you kids

For unraveling this
smuggling mystery for us.

Aw.

We just couldn't figure out
how those sheep rustlers

Got them across the
river without being seen.

Floating them downstream

In those barrels

With the air hoses

Was pretty ingenious.

First they'd shear
them here in the mill,

Then they'd ship them off

To the black market somewhere.

That's about it.

And the werewolf disguises

And the open grave

Were just to
scare off intruders.

Shucks. He didn't scare
scoob and me for a minute.

SCOOBY: [Howling]

What's that?

Oh, my gosh.

SCOOBY: [Howling]

SCOOBY: Scooby doo!

SCOOBY: Hee hee hee!
