Computer: TURN RIGHT AHEAD.

Fred: RIGHT IT IS,
NATLAS.

VELMA: I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY
A LEFT, FREDDY.

Computer:
ANOTHER RIGHT TURN AHEAD.

FRED: I CAN'T.
THERE'S NOWHERE TO TURN.

VELMA: I THINK YOUR NAVIGATOR IS
HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,
FREDDY.

FRED: NO WAY!

NATLAS IS
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM.

IT CAN GUIDE US
TO WITHIN 5 INCHES

OF OUR PROGRAMMED
DESTINATION.

Computer: GO LEFT FIRST.

YOU HAVE NOW ARRIVED
AT SUNSET BEACH.

PLEASE ENJOY YOUR DAY
AT THE SHORE.

SCOOBY: OH? HEE HEE HEE HEE.

DAPHNE: LOOK, EVERYBODY!

THERE'S SOMETHING
ON THE LOCAL NEWS
ABOUT THE CONTEST.

REPORTER: AND MAKING
HIS GRAND ENTRANCE

INTO THE SNOWBOARDING
COMPETITION BEARING
HIS NAME,

SOFTWARE BILLIONAIRE
BRUCE WILKINSON.

MR. WILKINSON--

FRED: HEY, THAT LOOKS JUST
LIKE THE MYSTERY MACHINE.

VELMA: IT IS
THE MYSTERY MACHINE!

WATCH THE ROAD,
FREDDY!

SHAGGY: WHOA, FRED!
GREAT PARKING KARMA!

FRED: WHOA,
SWEET FRONTSIDE AIR.

HEY, YOU'RE
GRETCHEN MUELLER.

YOU'VE BEEN
WINNING CONTESTS
ALL OVER EUROPE.

GRETCHEN: LUCKY BOY.
YOU WILL WATCH ME
WIN HERE AS WELL. CIAO.

REPORTER: AND HOW WILL
THESE HIGH-PROFILE GAMES

BE AFFECTED BY THE LOSS
OF OLYMPIC BRONZE MEDALIST
CHRIS KLUG

UNDER MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES?

WILKINSON: NANCY, I'M SURE
WITH A MILLION DOLLARS
AT STAKE,

THE OTHER COMPETITORS
WILL BE HUNGRY
FOR VICTORY.

FRED: CHRIS KLUG INJURED?

VELMA: "MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES"?

DAPHNE: $1 MILLION?!

SHAGGY: HUNGRY?

VELMA: I THINK WE OUGHT
TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK

WITH CHRIS KLUG.

FRED: TALK TO CHRIS KLUG?!
COOL!

YOU KNOW IN ASPEN
WHEN YOU NAILED
THAT 720 MID-TWIST,

THEN GRABBED
SOME FLYING SQUIRREL
IN THE VERY NEXT MOVE?

CHRIS KLUG: YEAH, FRED, RIGHT.

FRED: THAT WAS SO COOL!

CHRIS KLUG: THANKS, BRO.

I'M JUST BUMMED
I WON'T BE SHREDDIN'
THE POW HERE,

THANKS TO THAT
SUPERSIZE POPSICLE.

SHAGGY: POPSICLE?! WHERE?!

SCOOB AND I ARE,
LIKE, FAMISHED.

SCOOBY: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

VELMA: SO YOU REALLY
WERE ATTACKED

BY SOME KIND
OF CREATURE?

CHRIS KLUG: YEAH.
TRIPPY, HUH?

FRED: HMM.

THE BEST WAY
TO GET A HANDLE
ON THE MYSTERY

IS FROM THE INSIDE.

I'LL POSE AS ONE
OF THE PRO-BOARDERS.

DAPHNE: BUT, FREDDY,
THE MONSTER!

AVALANCHE: MONSTER?!

CHRIS KLUG: YO, AVALANCHE,
IT'S TRUE.

FULL-ON
SNOW CREATURE.

AVALANCHE: HMM. FREAKY.

I BELIEVE YOU, MAN.
A SERIOUS COMPETITOR
LIKE YOU

WOULD NEVER
PURPOSELY QUIT.

FRED: AVALANCHE ANDERSON!

WOW! YOU PRACTICALLY
INVENTED THE SPORT!

I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOUR MOVIES
SINCE I WAS A KID!

DAPHNE: YOU'RE A MOVIE STAR?!

AVALANCHE: NO, NO. I JUST DID
SOME ACTION MOVIES
WITH SNOWBOARDING CHASES.

SCOOBY: [BURP]

Daphne:
OH, NO. SCOOBY!

SCOOBY: HA HA HA. SCOOBY.

FRED: SCOOBY'S GONNA NEED
THAT EXTRA FUEL
TO KEEP HIM WARM

WHILE WE SEARCH
EVERY TRAIL FOR
THE SNOW CREATURE.

FRED: COME ON, VELMA.
TIME'S A-WASTIN'!

Velma: WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?!

Shaggy: NO OFFENSE, VELMA,
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE

YOU SHOULD BE KNOCKING
DOWN GIANT BOWLING PINS!

Scooby: [laughing] BOWLING PINS.
SCOOBY: I DON'T GET IT.

Velma: HMM HMM.

HA HA! VERY FUNNY.

YOU'LL BE LAUGHING
THROUGH YOUR HANDKERCHIEF

WHEN I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HASN'T CAUGHT A COLD.

Fred: SHH, GUYS!
SOMEONE'S COMING.

Reporter: CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW,
MORTY?!

HOW ABOUT NOW?

YES, I KNOW
WE NEED HIGHER RATINGS.

YES! DON'T WORRY.

I THINK I CAN VIRTUALLY
PROMISE YOU MORE VIEWERS.

WAIT. YOU'RE
BREAKING UP AGAIN.

Velma: HMM,
INTERESTING.

Fred: YEAH, YOU'D THINK
YOU CAN GET A LOT
CLEARER SIGNAL UP HERE.

Velma: NO,
WHAT I MEANT WAS

I WONDER HOW
SHE CAN GUARANTEE
HIGHER RATINGS.

Daphne: GUYS! LOOK!

Scooby: SNOW CREATURE!

Velma: I DON'T THINK SO,
SCOOBY,

UNLESS CHRIS
WAS EXAGGERATING.

THAT MYSTERY SNEAK
SURE ISN'T MADE
OF ICE AND SNOW.

Shaggy: I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S MADE OF
NO-FAT FROZEN YOGURT!

LET'S GET LOST!
Fred: I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
LET'S FOLLOW HIM!

Daphne: IT LOOKS
LIKE HE WAS HEADED

TO THAT OLD,
ABANDONED SKI JUMP.

[RUMBLING]

Velma: SCOOBY, IS THAT
YOUR STOMACH RUMBLING?

Scooby: UH-UH.

Daphne: WELL, THAT NOISE
IS GETTING LOUDER.

WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT IS?

Shaggy: WHY DON'T YOU ASK
[GULP] HIM?!

[ROARING]

Fred:
OK, GUYS, DON'T PANIC!

REMEMBER,
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

IT'S JUST A TERRIFYING
MONSTER SUIT

WITH SOME CREEP INSIDE.

Shaggy: THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MISSING
FROM YOUR THEORY, FRED.

Fred: WHAT?

Shaggy: LIKE, THE CREEP INSIDE!

[ALL SCREAMING]

Fred: HEY! YEAH!

WHY DON'T YOU PICK ON
SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE?!

WHOA! UNH!

OW!

MY LEG!

Theodore: GET THAT
OUTTA MY FACE!

Fred: HUH?

Daphne: WHAT'S GOING ON?!

Theodore: YOUR FRIEND HERE
JUST BROKE HIS LEG.

Velma: WHO ARE YOU?

Theodore: THEODORE--TRAIL MANAGER.

I KEEP THE SLOPES GROOMED,
CHAIR LIFTS RUNNIN',

AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M A TAXI SERVICE
FOR CLUMSY KIDS, TOO!

Velma: DIDN'T YOU SEE
THE ICE CREATURE?

Theodore: AW, QUIT YOUR CRAZY TALK

AND HELP ME
GET MR. GRACEFUL
INTO THE SNOW CAT.

Velma: THAT THEODORE GAVE ME
A SERIOUS CASE
OF THE CREEPS.

I THINK
OUR FRIEND THEODORE

COULD BEAR
A CLOSER EXAMINATION.

Shaggy: NO, THANKS!
WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH
IN THAT SNOWCAT.

SHEESH!

Velma: AH-CHOO!

THINK ABOUT IT.

HE SHOWED UP
JUST AFTER WE
SAW THE CREATURE.

WHY?

Fred: GOOD POINT!
LET'S CHECK HIM OUT.

Daphne: YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

YOU'RE GOING TO REST,
JUST LIKE THE DOCTOR SAID.

WE'LL GO INVESTIGATE.

Velma: HERE'S
THEODORE'S CABIN,

JUST LIKE
THE DESK CLERK SAID.

I HOPE HE DOESN'T MIND
IF WE LOOK AROUND.

Daphne: JEEPERS. LOOKS
LIKE HE DECORATED

IN RUSTIC,
MID-CENTURY CREEP.

Velma: AH-AH-AH-CHOO!

Shaggy: YOU OK?

VELMA, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET YOU SOME HOT SOUP,
LIKE, BACK AT THE LODGE.

Velma: I'M NOT TOO SICK
TO RECOGNIZE A CLUE
WHEN I SEE ONE.

LOOK!

Daphne: "CHAMPION SKI JUMPER
THEODORE SCHUSSMAN'S CAREER

"TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT
WHEN HE COLLIDED
WITH A YOUNG MAN

ON A SO-CALLED
SNOWBOARD." HMM.
Shaggy: HE MUST HAVE
BEEN PRETTY GOOD.

HE'S GOT MORE CUPS HERE
THAN AN ALL-NIGHT
COFFEE SHOP.

Velma: JINKIES,
A SKIING CHAMPION WHO LOST
HIS CAREER TO A SNOWBOARDER

MUST BE PRETTY BITTER.

Daphne: GESUNDHEIT.

JEEPERS. YOUR SNEEZES
ARE GETTING LOUDER, VELMA.

Velma: THAT'S NOT ME.
IT CAME FROM OUTSIDE.

[ROARING]

Shaggy: ZOINKS! I TELL YA,

THAT SNOWMAN
IS DEFINITELY NOT
A JOLLY, HAPPY SOUL!

Man: AAH!
HELP! MONSTER!

All: AVALANCHE ANDERSON!

Avalanche: I'M TELLIN' YOU, DOC,

IT WAS MADE TOTALLY
OF ICE AND SNOW.

OW!

Doctor: THAT ANKLE'S
PRETTY TENDER.

WE CAN TAKE YOU IN
FOR X-RAYS.

Avalanche: WHAT'S THE POINT?

I'M OUT
OF THE CONTEST.

THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

Wilkinson: WILL YOU KIDS
LEAVE ME ALONE?

I'VE GOT
ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

WITH ALL
THE BIG NAMES LEAVING,

MY SPONSORS ARE
PULLING OUT OF THE GAMES.

Daphne: PLEASE LISTEN.
FREDDY'S PLAN
IS BRILLIANT.

Fred: THE WAY I SEE IT,

THE CREATURE'S TARGETING
PROFESSIONAL BOARDERS.

THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO STICK A DECOY
INTO THE COMPETITION.

Wilkinson: I THINK ALL THIS
SNOW CREATURE BUSINESS
IS A LOT OF HOO-HA,

BUT IF IT'LL GET YOU
OFF MY BACK, FINE.

NOW, IF
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

Daphne: THERE'S SOMETHING
NOT QUITE RIGHT ABOUT
THAT BOSSY BILLIONAIRE.

Shaggy: I DON'T GET IT, FRED.

WITH YOUR BUSTED ANKLE,
WHO'S GOING TO BE
THE DECOY?

Scooby: REAH. WHO?

HUH?
HUH?

[GULP]

Shaggy: NO WAY! NEGATORY!
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

Daphne: COME ON, SHAGGY.

IT'S NOT LIKE YOU REALLY
HAVE TO SNOWBOARD.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FAKE IT

AND WAIT
FOR THAT CREATURE
TO COME AFTER YOU.

HERE THEY COME.
CATCH YOU LATER.

Gretchen: SO, YOU ARE THE HEAVY-HITTER,
LAST-MINUTE ENTRY

WE ARE HEARING ABOUT.

YEP. THAT'S ME,
Shaggy: THE INVINCIBLE SHAGINATOR.

Gretchen: HMM. SO YOU THINK
YOU'RE INVINCIBLE,
SHAGINATOR?

Shaggy: ZOINKS!

AAH!

Gretchen: SHAGINATOR CERTAINLY
HAS AN UNORTHODOX STYLE.

Shaggy: HEY, I'M, LIKE,
STILL ALIVE!

[ROARING]

Shaggy: HEY!

WHOA!

OHH!

AAH!

Scooby: SHAGGY?

WHOAAA!

AH-HA-HO!

WHOA!

[ROAR]

[ROAR]

[LAUGHING]

WHOA!

WHEW!
WHEW!

[ROAR]

Shaggy: YOU TOTALLY SAVED US!

LIKE, THANKS.

Velma: THERE WAS
ALL THIS STUFF
ON THE NET

ABOUT WILKINSON
SELLING OFF BIG CHUNKS
OF HIS EMPIRE
TO PAY HIS CREDITORS.

AH-AH-AH-CHOO!

[CRASH]

Daphne: VELMA, YOU'RE
TOO SICK TO THINK.

YOU CLIMB INTO BED
AND REST.

Fred: HEY, IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP,

THE ROOMS
ALL HAVE A BIG STACK OF OLD
SNOWBOARDING MOVIES ON DVD.

Velma: OH, LUCKY ME!

Daphne: FREDDY, LOOK!

THERE'S A LIGHT FLICKERING
AT THE TOP OF THE SKI JUMP.

Fred: WHERE'S
MY NIGHT-VISION SCOPE?

Daphne: TRÈS CONVENIENT!

Fred: HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
THERE'S THAT WEIRD GUY
FROM LAST NIGHT.

Daphne: I WONDER WHAT HE WAS DOING
IN THE SKI-JUMP GATE?

Fred: I'LL GO FIND OUT.

OW!

Daphne: YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE, MISTER.

DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

THIS TIME,
DAPHNE'S FLYING SOLO.

Fred: NO WAY.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR--

Daphne: FOR WHAT? FOR A GIRL?

I'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE.

Fred: WELL, I GUESS I CAN
WATCH OVER YOU FROM HERE

AND CALL YOUR CELL PHONE
IF I SEE ANYTHING.

BUT BE CAREFUL!

Daphne: AW, FREDDY,
AREN'T I ALWAYS?

YEAH!

[CELL PHONE RINGS]

HELLO?

Fred: YOU CALL THAT CAREFUL?

Daphne: OH, FREDDY, RELAX.

THERE'S NOTHING--

HEY! WHAT'S THIS?

Fred: DAPHNE,
GET OUT OF THERE.

THE CREATURE'S COMING!

IT'S COMING!

Daphne: WHAT DID YOU SAY?

I DIDN'T CATCH THAT.

[GRRR]

JEEPERS! I THINK
I JUST GOT THE MESSAGE!

[ROAR]

[ROAR]

Daphne: EAT PRO-INTENSITY
STYLING HEAT,
SLUSH-FACE!

[ROAR]

Fred: GET OUTTA THERE!

WHEW!

Shaggy: MMM-MMM!

MY FAMOUS GARLIC,
RED CHILI, ONION,
TABASCO SAUCE CONSOMMÉ

OUGHT TO FIGHT OFF
THAT CHILL.

Velma: I THOUGHT I'D FIND
YOU TWO HERE.

[MUTTERING]

Wilkinson: COME ON, GUYS,
YOU JUST HAVE TO COMPETE.

THE WILKINSON EMPIRE
IS RELYING ON THESE GAMES.

Avalanche: SORRY, RICH DUDE,
NO CAN DO.

Shaggy: WELL, HOW DO YOU
LIKE THAT?

Velma: SHH! SHAGGY, LOOK!

Reporter/Nancy Chang:[DIALS]

IT'S ME.

Velma: THAT NANCY CHANG WAS THERE
LISTENING THE ENTIRE TIME.

AND REMEMBER HOW DESPERATE
FOR RATINGS SHE IS?

VERY STRANGE.

AH-AH-CHOO!

Daphne: NOT AS STRANGE
AS A BILLIONAIRE
WITH NO BILLIONS.

Shaggy: AT LEAST THE CONTESTANTS
HAVE MOTIVES,

LIKE A MILLION ONE-DOLLAR
MOTIVES TO BE EXACT.

HEY, WE CAN'T FORGET
ABOUT CREEPY OLD THEODORE.

Velma: RIGHT,
OR THAT MYSTERY SNEAK.

AH-CHOO!

Fred: HOW IS THIS MYSTERY
CONNECTED TO THE CREATURE?

AND HOW DO WE STOP
THAT FROZEN FREAK?

Velma: HMM.

Shaggy: I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT "HMM."

IT ALWAYS COMES
RIGHT BEFORE FRED'S PLAN,

AND THE PLAN USUALLY
ENTAILS YOU AND ME BEING...

Scooby: RIVE RAIT?

Shaggy: YEAH! "RIVE RAIT!"

HEY, SNOWMAN,
CHECK IT OUT!

I GOT YOUR CORNCOB PIPE
AND YOUR BUTTON NOSE
RIGHT HERE!

Scooby: HUH?

Shaggy: NOT NOW, SCOOB.
I'M ON A ROLL.

[RUMBLING]

SCOOB, DON'T TELL ME
THERE'S A HUGE, UGLY
SNOW CREATURE

RIGHT BEHIND US.

Scooby: YEAH.

Shaggy: LIKE, I ASKED YOU
NOT TO TELL ME THAT!

AAH!
AAH!

Fred: THEN VELMA PULLS THE ROPE,

TOPPLING THE SLALOM DRUMS
ONTO MR. SNOW-MEISTER,

AND DAPHNE BLASTS HIM
WITH THE SNOW-MAKING MACHINE.

Velma: THIS COLD IS KILLING ME.

AH...AH...AH...

Daphne: HERE THEY COME!

Shaggy: LIKE, GANGWAY!

[ROAR]

Velma: AH...AH...AH-CHOO!

* LA LA LA LA *

* LA LA LA LA *

Shaggy: HUH?
Scooby: HUH?

Shaggy: AAH!
Scooby: AAH!

[ROAR]

Velma: OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

Shaggy: SO, MR. FROSTY-FREEZY
WAS A FAKE AFTER ALL.

Fred: HE'S MADE ENTIRELY OF SOME KIND
OF SEE-THROUGH LUCITE

FASHIONED
TO LOOK LIKE ICE,

EVEN THE MOVING PARTS.

Daphne: SURE. THAT'S WHY
I COULDN'T MELT HIM
WITH MY DRIER.

Shaggy: BUT IF HE'S
REMOTE-CONTROLLED,

WHO'S HOLDING
THE REMOTE?

Daphne: LOOK! UP THERE!

Shaggy: IT'S
THAT MYSTERY SNEAK!

HE'S GETTING AWAY!

Velma: AH...AH...AH...AH...

AH-CHOO!

[ECHOING]
CHOO...CHOO...CHOO!

Fred: AND NOW
FOR THE BIG UNVEILING.

All:
AVALANCHE ANDERSON!

Velma: JUST AS I SUSPECTED
ALL ALONG.

Shaggy: YEAH, LIKE, ME, TOO.

BUT, UH, JUST
TO COMPARE NOTES,
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

Velma: STUCK IN MY ROOM
WATCHING HIS OLD MOVIES,

I REALIZED AVALANCHE
MUST HAVE CONNECTIONS
IN HOLLYWOOD,

SPECIFICALLY IN
THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WORLD.

Fred: AND HE CONTROLLED IT WITH
THIS VIRTUAL REALITY HELMET

AND THESE GLOVES.

THAT'S WHY
IT MOVED AND ACTED
LIKE A REAL LIVING CREATURE.

Velma: AND ALL THAT CELL PHONE
INTERFERENCE?

IT WAS CAUSED BY A POWERFUL
REMOTE CONTROL AMPLIFIER.

Daphne: THAT'S WHY AVALANCHE
BROADCAST FROM THE TOP
OF THE SKI JUMP--

BECAUSE THE SIGNAL
WAS STRONGEST THERE.

Shaggy: BUT WE, LIKE, SAW HIM
WOUNDED BY THE CREATURE,
DIDN'T WE?

Velma: NO. WE SAW HIM
LYING IN THE SNOW.

HE TOLD US
HE WAS ATTACKED.

AVALANCHE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE
A MIRACULOUS RECOVERY.

Chris Klug: BUT, AVALANCHE, WHY?

Avalanche: I USED TO BE
THE BEST IN THE WORLD.

I WANTED THAT BACK!

AND THE ONLY THING
STANDING IN MY WAY WAS YOU!

IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU
INTERLOPING ADOLESCENTS...

Velma: THAT'S
"MEDDLING KIDS."

Avalanche: AND THAT GLUTTONOUS MUTT,

I'D BE FAMOUS AGAIN!

Fred: OH, YOU'LL
BE FAMOUS, ALL RIGHT,

WITH BOTH
THE AUTHORITIES

AND THE NATIONAL
SNOWBOARDING COMMISSION.

Shaggy: CHECK OUT
THE SHREDDAGE!

IT'S GONNA BE
A SWEET CONTEST AFTER ALL.

Chris Klug: YOU KNOW, OFFICIALLY
YOU'RE STILL ENTERED
IN THE CONTEST, SHAGGY.

WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A RIDE?

Shaggy: UH-UH. NO WAY!

I'VE HAD
ENOUGH SCARY RUNS
TO LAST ME A LIFETIME.

NOTHING,
AND I MEAN NOTHING,

COULD GET ME
DOWN THAT SLOPE!

[ROAR]

IT'S THE SNOW CREATURE!

AAH!

WHOA-HO-HO-HO!

WHOA!

WHOA-OH!

OH!

Shaggy: WHAT'S THIS FOR?

Daphne: YOU WON, SHAGGY.

Shaggy: I WON
A MILLION DOLLARS?

THAT'S A LOT
OF CURLY FRIES!

HA HA HA HA!

I'M SO STOKED!
LIKE, WHERE'S
THE CHECK?

Velma: YOU'D BETTER ASK HIM.

Wilkinson: VERY FUNNY.

IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD,

I'M OUT
OF THE BILLIONAIRE
BUSINESS.

Theodore: WILKINSON,
BACK TO WORK!

Shaggy: OH, WELL.
EASY COME...

HA HA HA HA!

EASY GO!

RIGHT, SCOOB?

Scooby: REAH!

SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO!
