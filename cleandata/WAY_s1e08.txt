THAT'S A FACT!
TIME TO GO, GANG.
IT'S GETTING DARK.
HEY, LET'S HAVE THAT
LAST CLAM, SCOOBY.
SCOOBY: COMING UP. SCOOBY DOO!
GOOD SHOT!
I'VE HEARD OF BIRD
DOGS AND RABBIT DOGS,
BUT YOU'RE THE FIRST
CLAM DOG I EVER HEARD OF.
SCOOBY: CLAM DOG? YUK!
SHAGGY, YOU KNOW
SCOOBY DOESN'T LIKE CLAMS.
Shaggy: I LIKE 'EM.
THEY'RE FUN TO DIG AND
EVEN MORE FUN TO EAT.
HEY, DON'T YOU WISH
FUNLAND WAS OPEN?
THE ROOT BEER FLOATS,
THE CHOCOLATE CUSTARD,
THE RIDES... MAN, THAT'S LIVING.
Daphne: YES, BUT RIGHT NOW
IT LOOKS A LITTLE SPOOKY...
EVEN HAUNTED.
SCOOBY: HAUNTED?
Velma: DON'T BE SILLY, DAPHNE.
HEY, LOOK AT THAT!
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT PLACE WON'T
BE OPEN FOR WEEKS.
Shaggy: LOOK!
WELL, THIS CALLS FOR
A LITTLE INVESTIGATION.
Fred: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.
EVERYTHING'S RUNNING,
BUT NOBODY'S HERE.
MAN, IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.
LET'S CHECK OUT THAT LUNCH
COUNTER OVER THERE, SCOOBY.
A LITTLE SERVICE, PLEASE?
FOR OPENERS, I'D LIKE A MALT
AND A HOT DOG WITH
ALL THE TRIMMINGS.
SCOOBY: ME, TOO.
WHO DID THAT?
HEY, I USED TO BE
PRETTY GOOD AT THIS.
SHOULD I GIVE IT A WHIRL?
GO AHEAD. WHO'S TO KNOW?
OK. BATTER UP!
GOOD THROW, FREDDY!
WELL, I'VE STILL
GOT THE OLD TOUCH.
LET'S GO FIND SHAGGY AND SCOOBY.
GEE, FREDDY, SHOULDN'T WE
STACK THOSE BOTTLES BACK UP?
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAPHNE.
LOOK! THE BOTTLES ARE
ALL STACKED UP AGAIN!
AND WHAT'S THAT ON THE COUNTER?
IT'S A PRIZE FOR KNOCKING
DOWN THE BOTTLES,
AND OUR BACKS WERE
ONLY TURNED FOR A MINUTE.
OH, WOW! FREDDY,
THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.
WELL, SOMEHOW I GOT THIS PRIZE,
SO THE LEAST I CAN
DO IS PAY MY 2 BITS.
WHAT A CUTE KEWPIE DOLL.
OH, NO!
THE CASH REGISTER
RANG UP 25 CENTS.
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF THIS PLACE  HAUNTED.
HEY, SCOOBY, DO YOU
THINK WE STAND A CHANCE
OF GETTING SOME
COTTON CANDY, TOO?
SCOOBY: YEAH!
HOLD IT. I JUST SAW SOMEBODY.
THERE HE GOES AGAIN!
MAN, HE'S FASTER THAN
A SPEEDING BULLET.
SCOOBY: SUPERMAN!
COME ON, SCOOBY.
PICK UP THE SCENT.
SCOOBY: NO SCENT.
NO SCENT? HE HAS
TO HAVE A SCENT.
WHY, HE'D HAVE TO BE A GHOST
NOT TO LEAVE A SCENT. UH...
DID I SAY GHOST?
SCOOBY: UH-HUH. UH-OH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
SCOOBY: I'M POINTING.
YOU'RE POINTING?
OH! I SEE HIM.
THAT WAS NO GHOST.
HE LOOKS MORE LIKE
A MAN FROM MARS.
WOW! LOOK WHAT THAT
LAST HOT DOG DID TO ME!
SCOOBY: HEE HEE HEE!
SCOOBY: LOOK AT ME!
HEE HEE HEE!
I KNEW I WAS SHARP...
BUT THIS POINTED
HEAD IS TOO MUCH.
HA HA HA!
SCOOBY: WHOA! A GIANT MOUSE!
THAT'S NO GIANT MOUSE.
IT'S ONLY A LITTLE MOUSE.
HA HA HA!
WHOA!
SCOOBY DOO, WHERE ARE YOU?
YOW!
SCOOBY: WOW!
THERE HE IS!
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LET'S GO FIND THE OTHERS.
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO! I'M WITH YOU!
I DON'T SEE SCOOBY
OR SHAGGY ANYWHERE.
THERE'S SOMEONE GOING
ALONG BEHIND THAT FENCE.
IT'S NO ONE WE KNOW,
BUT WHOEVER IT IS,
I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM
A FEW QUESTIONS.
HE'S TAKING A RIDE
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL.
IT STOPPED.
THAT MAN IS TRAPPED UP ON TOP.
I'LL GET HIM DOWN. I
WANT TO TALK TO HIM.
I'LL HAVE TO CRANK THE
WHEEL DOWN BY HAND.
WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM UP THERE.
Velma: YOU'VE TURNED
IT ALL THE WAY AROUND,
BUT HE'S GONE.
BUT HE COULDN'T
HAVE CLIMBED DOWN
WITHOUT US SEEING HIM.
LOOK! THE LIGHTS ARE GOING OFF
ALL OVER THE PARK!
WELL, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I
EVER WANTED TO LEAVE FUNLAND.
SCOOBY AND I SAW HIM...
STRICTLY A WEIRDO
FROM OUTER SPACE.
WE SAW HIM, TOO.
LOOK OVER THERE.
I WONDER WHOSE HOUSE THAT IS.
Fred: IT COULD BE THE CARETAKER.
LET'S GO SEE.
WE SHOULD TELL HIM ABOUT
THESE MYSTERIOUS HAPPENINGS.
I HOPE HE'S A NICE,
SWEET, OLD CARETAKER.
AND BELIEVE ME, MR. JENKINS,
ALL THE RIDES WERE RUNNING.
Mr. Jenkins: I DON'T SEE HOW.
WELL, SHE WAS SURE
RUNNING WIDE OPEN...
LIGHTS, MUSIC, EVERYTHING.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WE'RE THE CARETAKERS HERE.
MY BROTHER AND I WOULD
HAVE SEEN THE LIGHTS.
SARAH'S RIGHT.
WELL, WE SAW A VERY
STRANGE CHARACTER
RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE.
HE WAS, LIKE, WEIRDO.
SCOOBY: WEIRDO-LIKE.
FIDDLESTICKS! BESIDES US,
THERE'S NO ONE
ELSE ON THIS ISLAND.
MAYBE THE MOONLIGHT
WAS PLAYING TRICKS ON YOU.
BUT, MAN, I TELL YOU...
Fred: LET IT GO, SHAGGY.
SORRY TO HAVE BOTHERED YOU, SIR.
LET'S GO, GANG.
WELL, HOW DID YOU LIKE THAT
FOR DOUBLE-TALK?
WE CAN'T GO HOME NOW.
WE KNOW WE DIDN'T IMAGINE
ALL THOSE KOOKY
THINGS THAT HAPPENED.
COUNT ME OUT.
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ANY CREEP
WITH A FROZEN FACE.
SCOOBY: UH-UH.
SHAGGY, SOMETIMES I THINK
YOU'D RATHER EAT PIZZA PIE
THAN SOLVE A MYSTERY.
LET'S VOTE ON IT...
MYSTERY OR PIZZA PIE?
SCOOBY: PIZZA PIE.
CUT IT OUT, YOU TWO.
COME ON. LET'S GET
BACK TO THE BEACH.
OK, WE'LL KEEP A
WATCH FROM HERE.
IT'S SURE DARK.
WHAT DO THEY CALL
THIS, A STAKEOUT?
I'D RATHER HAVE A STEAK IN.
LIKE A SIRLOIN
STEAK IN ME, THAT IS.
SCOOBY: ME, TOO. YEAH!
SCOOBY: MMM!
OH, STOP IT! STOP
IT! I CAN'T STAND IT!
BE QUIET, YOU TWO.
WE'VE BEEN HERE AN HOUR,
AND NO SIGN OF LIFE.
WE'LL GIVE IT 10 MINUTES MORE.
UH-OH.
IS THAT MUSIC I HEAR?
LOOK! ALL THE
LIGHTS ARE GOING ON!
HERE WE GO AGAIN!
NO DOUBT THIS TIME.
LET'S GET OVER THERE QUICK!
SOMETHING'S HAYWIRE.
Daphne: WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE MERRY-GO-ROUND?
IT'S RUNNING BACKWARDS.
LOOK AT THAT COTTON
CANDY MACHINE.
IT'S RUNNING WILD!
AND THE HOT DOG
STAND. I CAN'T STAND IT!
SCOOBY: HUH?
HEY!
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SCOOBY?
I LIKE TO EAT, TOO, YOU KNOW.
LOOK! THERE'S THAT
STRANGE GUY AGAIN.
Daphne: WHAT A TIME
FOR A SIDESHOW.
Fred: COME ON,
EVERYBODY. AFTER HIM!
Daphne: LOOK WHAT HE'S DOING.
SCOOBY: WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?
SCOOBY: HELP! SHAGGY, HE'S GOT ME!
SCOOBY: YOW!
YOW!
LET GO! LET GO!
HE GOT ME! HE GOT ME! HELP!
NO, HE DIDN'T.
THERE HE GOES NOW
INTO THE TUNNEL OF LOVE,
SO WE HAVE TO GO INTO
THE TUNNEL AFTER HIM.
I WANT TO GO, LIKE, HOME.
ROW FASTER! WE CAN CATCH HIM!
Shaggy: THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THAT TUNNEL!
IT'S HIM!
Fred: HE'S SWIMMING RIGHT AT US!
I THOUGHT 
WANTED TO CATCH 
Shaggy: LIKE A TORPEDO,
HE'S GOING TO RAM US!
DON'T PANIC! I'LL SAVE YOU!
THANKS, SHAGGY, BUT WHY
DON'T WE JUST WALK OUT?
HUH? OH, YEAH. GOOD IDEA.
THAT'S NO ORDINARY MAN.
HE'S GOING TO BE
HARD TO TRACK DOWN.
HE'D BETTER LOOK
OUT I DON'T CATCH HIM.
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY
FOR WHAT HE DID TO MY HAIR.
SCOOBY: LET'S GO BACK.
WE CAN'T GO BACK, SCOOBY.
FREDDY SAID TO LOOK
ON THIS SIDE OF THE PARK.
NOW, IT'S OK
JUST TO FOR
THE TORPEDO MAN,
AS LONG AS WE DON'T FIND HIM.
SCOOBY: WHAT'S THAT?
HUH? OH, THAT.
THAT'S A REAL FUN GAME, SCOOBY.
COME ON. I'LL SHOW
YOU HOW IT WORKS.
NOW, YOU TAKE THIS HAMMER,
AND YOU HIT THAT BUTTON.
THE BALL GOES UP TO THE
TOP AND RINGS THE BELL.
NOW WATCH THE OLD MASTER.
UH! UH! UH!
WHOA!
HEE HEE HEE!
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
UH! UH! UH!
NOW I GOT IT!
HEY, WHATCHA DOING?
SCOOBY: MY TURN.
YOUR TURN? WITH YOUR TAIL?
LET ME OUT OF THE WAY.
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
HEE HEE HEE!
HA HA! HEY, THAT WAS GREAT!
YOU GOT TO HAVE
THE STRONGEST TAIL IN THE WORLD.
UH-OH. IT'S HIM.
HE WINS! LET'S GO, MAN!
HE'S GAINING ON US!
HEAD FOR THE ROLLER COASTER!
YIPES! HE'S CLIMBING
UP THE CARS AFTER US!
LET'S GO, SCOOBY!
HERE WE GO!
AAH! AAH!
YOW! WE'RE TRAPPED!
LOOK! THERE'S SHAGGY AND SCOOBY
IN THE FRONT SEAT OF THAT CAR!
AND THAT STRANGE
MAN IS AFTER THEM!
Daphne: THERE'S AN EMPTY
CAR GOING UP THE OTHER TRACK.
I'LL SLOW IT DOWN, AND
MAYBE THEY'LL JUMP INTO IT.
JUMP, SHAGGY!
THEY MADE IT!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
WHEW!
NICE JUMP, YOU GUYS.
THANKS, GANG.
BUT DON'T EVER LET
US DO THAT AGAIN.
I THINK THAT CHARACTER'S TRAIN
IS COMING IN.
Fred: EVERYBODY HIDE
BEHIND THOSE CRATES.
Daphne: BUT IT'S EMPTY.
HOW COULD HE GET OUT?
LOOK! HE'S UP THERE!
WHAT'S HE GOING TO DO?
Fred: HE'S DIVING OFF!
COME ON! HE COULD BE HURT!
LET'S GO, SCOOBY!
HE'S NOT HERE!
THERE'S WHERE HE
CRASHED THROUGH THE TENT.
Velma: AND YOU CAN SEE
WHERE HE HIT THAT CRATE.
IT DEFIES ALL THE
KNOWN LAWS OF PHYSICS.
I WISH YOU COULD
HAVE SEEN HIS EYES...
LIKE 2 TAILLIGHTS ON A HOT ROD.
SCOOBY: YEAH! HOT ROD!
Fred: HOT ROD! THAT'S IT!
THE ANSWER IS THAT THIS
GUY CAN MOVE SO FAST,
WE NEED SOMETHING
FAST TO CATCH HIM.
AND WE'RE GOING TO
SOUP UP THIS ELECTRIC CAR
TO CATCH HIM?
RIGHT. WE'LL INCREASE
THE FLOW OF POWER
FROM THE BATTERY.
THIS MIGHT JAZZ IT UP.
NO, SHAGGY!
YOU TURNED IT ON AT THE MOTOR!
Daphne: NOW VELMA CAN'T STOP IT!
MY GLASSES! I LOST THEM!
THERE'S NO BRAKES, SCOOBY,
AND I CAN'T SEE
WITHOUT MY GLASSES,
BUT IT'S A NICE, WIDE STREET.
OH, DON'T FRET, SCOOBY.
SCOOBY: HEY, THAT'S HIM!
OH, I SEE THE
TRAFFIC COP, SILLY.
RIGHT TURN, ISN'T IT?
SCOOBY: MOVE, VELMA!
HEY, SCOOBY, ARE WE
IN THE RIGHT LANE NOW?
SCOOBY: RIGHT LANE?
SCOOBY: YIPE!
SCOOBY: TRAIN COMING!
TRAIN COMING?
I TOLD YOU I CAN'T STOP.
THE TRAIN WILL JUST HAVE
TO LOOK OUT FOR ITSELF.
HERE THEY COME!
LOOK OUT FOR THE
COTTON CANDY, VELMA!
I THINK WE'VE STALLED.
WOW, AT LEAST YOU'RE
SAFE. WHAT LUCK.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LUCK?
WE DIDN'T HAVE A BIT
OF TROUBLE. ASK SCOOBY.
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
WELL, THAT DOES IT.
BUT THIS GUY IS SURE
STRONG AND FAST.
SO WE'VE HAD TO BUILD
THE PRIZE TRAP OF ALL-TIME
TO CATCH HIM,
AND THIS CRATE IS IT.
NOW HERE'S THE PLAN.
SOMEONE WILL LURE THE
STRANGER INTO THIS TRAP.
BUT OUR MAN WILL BE
TRAPPED IN THE CRATE
WITH THAT WEIRDO.
NO. LOOK UP THERE.
WE'LL PULL OUR
MAN OUT OF THE TRAP
IN THE BASKET.
SHAGGY WILL LOCK THE DOOR,
AND VELMA AND I WILL
PULL UP THE BASKET.
AND ALL SCOOBY HAS TO DO
IS LURE THE STRANGER
INTO THE TRAP.
SCOOBY: UH-UH.
ANYBODY GOT A SCOOBY SNACK?
SCOOBY: NO SNACKS. NOT ME.
IT'S NOT FAIR. I'LL
GO WITH SCOOBY.
WE CAN USE THE DODGE 'EM CAR.
SCOOBY: NO CAR! I'LL GO! I'LL GO!
AAH!
SCOOBY: SET THE TRAP! SET THE TRAP!
SET THE TRAP!
GET READY, EVERYONE!
HERE THEY COME!
WE GOT HIM!
Velma: SCOOBY'S SAFE!
WE GOT HIM TRAPPED! WE GOT HIM!
WHAT WAS THAT?
UH-OH. LIKE, YOU
WON'T BELIEVE IT.
HE WENT THROUGH
THE BACK OF THE TRAP,
THEN THROUGH A WOODEN CRATE
AND OUT THE BACK
THROUGH A BRICK WALL!
WHAT A MAN! HE'S NOT HUMAN!
Man: YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
HE'S NOT HUMAN. HE'S A ROBOT.
Velma: IT'S MR. JENKINS
THE CARETAKER!
WHAT DID YOU SAY, SIR?
HE'S CHARLIE...
THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT ROBOT.
I PROGRAMMED HIM
TO OPERATE
EVERYTHING IN FUNLAND.
BUT WHY?
I WANTED TO MAKE ENOUGH ROBOTS
TO RUN THE WHOLE PARK.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?
YOUR ROBOT'S BEEN
TEARING UP THE PLACE.
SOMEHOW HE GOT OUT OF CONTROL,
BUT WE CAN STOP HIM
IF YOU KIDS WILL HELP ME.
SCOOBY: HERE WE GO AGAIN.
HOW DOES THIS EQUIPMENT
WORK, MR. JENKINS?
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.
ONCE WE FIND CHARLIE,
THE POWERFUL ELECTRIC MAGNET
WILL PULL HIS METAL BODY TO IT.
SLOW DOWN.
CHARLIE'S CLOSE BY.
LOOK AT THAT NEEDLE.
TURN ON THE BIG MAGNET.
IT'S ON.
AIM IT OVER AT THAT SHACK.
I SAW SOMETHING MOVE.
DON'T FIGHT IT, CHARLIE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
THIS CABLE HAS BEEN CUT.
Daphne: CHARLIE'S CRASHED!
I WAS AFRAID OF THAT.
THE ELECTROMAGNET HAS
FOULED UP HIS CIRCUITS.
HEY, SCOOBY'S UP TO SOMETHING.
SOMEBODY'S BEHIND THAT FENCE.
COME OUT OF THERE!
Mr. Jenkins: SARAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
IT WAS ME THAT CAUSED CHARLIE
TO GO OUT OF CONTROL.
I DON'T THINK ROBOTS SHOULD WORK
WHERE CHILDREN COME TO HAVE FUN.
SHE'S RIGHT. CHARLIE IS NICE,
BUT KIDS NEED HUMANS.
SCOOBY: YEAH, YEAH, YEAH! YEAH!
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
I JUST WANTED A PERFECT ROBOT,
BUT NEVER MIND.
I'LL REBUILD HIM AND
CALL HIM CHARLIE II.
WELL, KIDS, CHARLIE'S REPAIRED,
AND I THINK HE'S
BETTER THAN EVER.
THAT GREAT, MR. JENKINS.
WE CAME BACK TODAY TO
SEE IF YOU HAD HIM FIXED UP.
HEY, WHERE'S SCOOBY?
WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?
HE'S GETTING HIS EARS SCRATCHED.
SCOOBY: OH, BOY! OH, BOY!
SCOOBY: OH, BOY! OH, BOY! OH, BOY!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOOBY DOO!
