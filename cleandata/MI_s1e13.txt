Kelsepsian: On my way home, darling. 
Voice: You did not heed my warning.
Kelsepsian: Honey? What's wrong with your voice? It's so deep. Wait a minute, is this that nut again?
Voice: I told you, if you do not quit your job at Destroido and leave forever, something terrible will happen to you. 
Kelsepsian: And I told you I don't appreciate prank calls! My sister-in-law is a paralegal, and if this keeps up, I'm suing you! Go suck a lemon! Oh, boy, the nerve of some people!
Kelsepsian: Ew. One of those cicada thingies. I hate those bugs. Bleugh! 
Kelsepsian: What's goin' on?! Hey! Go away! Come on! Shoo, shoo! Aah! Aah! Oh! I GIVE UP!!!!
Cicada Creature: I warned you!
Yantz: The cicada, the most perfect insect in a decidedly-imperfect world. 
Fred: Did he just kiss a bug?
Daphne: Yeah. Isn't he just the best?
Yantz: The cicada's life cycle is fascinating. As grubs, they burrow into the ground, where they spend the next seventeen years. 
Scooby: Want one?
Velma: Not from you, I don't.
Scooby: Can't we just be friends?
Velma: Ask me in seventeen years. 
Yantz: Changes in our ecosystem, though, could wipe off the precious cicada, which is why we need to keep watch on companies who pollute nature. Isn't that right, Shaggy and Scooby?
Scooby: Huh?
Shaggy: Pardon?
Yantz: Are you aware that Grandma Moonbeam's Nature Slivers are manufactured by Destroido, and every bite you take supports the biggest polluter in Crystal Cove?!
Shaggy: No, they're, like, super-good!
Scooby: Yeah! Want one?
Yantz: I don't even know why I let you take this class. 
Fred: That guy's a total nut. 
Daphne: Hm, I think Dr. Yantz is amazing.
Fred: What? What are you talkin' about? 
Daphne: Well, for one thing, he's... he's intelligent.
Velma: And cute. 
Fred: Yeah?! Well, I'd wonder how cute he'd look caught in one of my traps! A real mean one!
Shaggy: Like, are you okay, Freddy?
Fred: Of course, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be okay?
Shaggy: I dunno, you just seem a little, um...
Scooby: Jealous. 
Fred: What?! What are you talkin' about? Jealous? I'm not jealous. 
Shaggy: Okay, whatever you- oh...
Shaggy: It's a note from Mr. E! Must have been the back of my Nature Slivers. He says, "There's a mystery waiting for us at the hospital." There's been some sort of weird accident!
Fred: What kind of accident?
Shaggy: He says we'll find out when we get there.
Velma: Looks like Mr. E's right. Something's up. That's Sheriff Stone's car.
Shaggy: Like, maybe we can stop by the cafeteria when we're done and get some of that delicious hospital gelatin. 
Scooby: Reah! With saltines, and applesauce... 
Shaggy: And gelatin. 
Fred: Oh, uh... hey, Daphne.
Daphne: Yes?
Fred: Uh... right, well, I was just wondering if maybe, you know, you'd like to, uh... go on a... duh... duh... d-d-
Daphne: A date? A real date? A date-date?
Fred: Yeah! You and me. There's a new trap exhibit at the museum. 
Daphne: Ugh, traps. Gee, Fred. When you said you wanted to take me on a date, for a minute, I thought you meant it.
Fred: I do mean it! You love traps!
Daphne: No, Fred. You love traps. 
Fred: Uh...
Nurse: Steady now...
Nurse: There. 
Sheriff: Get it off, get off! Get off, get off, oh! 
Mayor: Calm down. It's just a bug.
Sheriff: Help!
Sheriff: Ew, ew, ew! Thank you. Ick.
Fred: Dad?
Mayor: Oh, no.
Fred: Can we help you with anything?
Mayor: No. Go away. 
Velma: Who's the patient?
Mayor: An employee at Destroido. Go away.
Shaggy: Like, what happened to him?
Mayor: It's classified. Go away.
Sheriff: It was this awful creature made of thousands and thousands of cicada bugs! It got in his hair, his nose, all over him! Ew, ew! Gross! Ick.
Mayor: What are you, three years old?! All right, fine, yes. A bug creature, okay? And I'm not gonna let a golden opportunity like this go to waste. I already talked with the city council. We're gonna have a Cicada Bug Creature Festival this weekend. The crowds will be huge! And if you have any human decency left in your hearts, you will not get involved!
Fred: Sorry, dad, but we can't do that. 
Hugh Dederdee: Hello?
Voice: You did not heed my warning. 
Hugh Dederdee: You again? I'm taking a shower. Stop calling me!
Voice: I told you. If you do not quit your job at Destroido and leave town forever, something terrible will happen!
Hugh Dederdee: Blah, blah, blah. Leave me alone! 
Hugh Dederdee: Wha? A bug?
Commercial jingle: From fields and rivers come Nature Slivers, fish oil, flax, and wheat, Grandma Moonbeam cooks in her kitchen to give you good things to eat. Nature Slivers!
Commercial announcer: When you want fish oil, flax, and wheat in one crunchy bite, bite Nature Slivers! A division of Destroido.
Scooby: I wanna bite some Nature Slivers. I'm starving!
Shaggy: Like, me, too.
Fred: Okay, gang. I got it. Room 24B.
Grandma Moonbeam: There, there, poor dear. Such an ordeal. 
Daphne: Mr. Dederdee, mind if we ask you a few questions?
Velma: We heard about your bug attack last night.
Hugh Dederdee: Come on in. I'm not going anywhere. 
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, I should go. Feel better, dear. 
Mystery Inc.: Huh?!
Shaggy and Scooby: Grandma Moonbeam?!
Shaggy: We're, like, your biggest fans!
Scooby: Nature Slivers! Yummy!
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, now, isn't that nice. After I sold my company to Destroido, Hugh here has been instrumental in making them so popular among young people. 
Fred: You work at Destroido, too?
Hugh Dederdee: Mm-hm. 
Velma: Just like the other victim.
Grandma Moonbeam: Well, I'll leave you all to talk. 
Fred: Mr. Dederdee, do you have any idea why you were attacked?
Hugh Dederdee: Not really. Got a call a couple of weeks ago. Some deep-voiced creepy guy said if I didn't quit my job at Destroido, something terrible would happen to me. I never thought it would be... 
Hugh Dederdee: Eugh. Disgusting... 
Daphne: Uh, thanks again, Mr. Dederdee. 
Intercom: Code Blue. Crash cart in Room 613. 
Fred: Great question-and-answer session, eh, gang?
Fred: Uh, hit lobby, will you, Shag? 
Velma: Hmph.
Velma: Nice one, dog-boy. You pressed the wrong button. This is the basement.
Shaggy: No, I didn't. Like, see? Lobby. 
Scooby: Hm, must be broken. 
Scooby: Bugs!
Cicada Creature: Cease your useless investigations, or something terrible will happen to you, tomorrow night! Heed my warning. Heed it! Heed! 
Velma: There has to be some reason the victims all work for Destroido.
Shaggy: Like, maybe whosever behind it doesn't like the company.
Daphne: But who could train thousands of bugs to attack like that?
Fred: Same person who kisses them!
Daphne: What?
Fred: Dr. Yantz! It all fits! Remember what he said in class about Destroido being one of the biggest polluters in Crystal Cove? He hates that company!
Daphne: It's not Dr. Yantz. 
Velma: Wait a minute, Daphne. Fred might be onto something. Dr. Yantz is an expert on cicada. He could have trained them to-
Daphne: It's not Dr. Yantz!
Fred: How do you know?
Daphne: Because... because... because... 
Fred: Because he's cute? I see the way you look at him. Did he give you his phone number? You probably already texted him!
Daphne: What if I did? And what if we made plans to go to the trap exhibit, without you?!
Fred: Wha?! 
Scooby: Is he back in there?
Fred: Let's go.
Daphne: You're making a big mistake, Fred.
Fred: Big mistakes is what I do. 
Yantz: 
Fred: The jig is up, Dr. Yantz! Watch out for his weapon, gang. No doubt he's got the cicada under some sort of brain control!
Yantz: I was putting them to sleep. It's their bedtime.
Shaggy: Huh, that's a good one. Right, Scooby-Doo? Huh?
Yantz: What is going on here?
Fred: You know exactly what's going on, girlfriend-stealer! 
Daphne: Girlfriend? Really?!
Velma: You've been using cicada bugs to attack employees at Destroido.
Yantz: Are you insane? I'm callin' the police.
Mayor: Quiet! Now, one at a time. 
Fred: Dr. Yantz is the cicada creature, dad!
Sheriff: You are? Ohhh.
Mayor: Let's not jump to conclusions. But if you are the cicada creature, would you mind showing up at the Cicada Festival tomorrow? It'll be a big help.
Yantz: I am not the cicada creature!
Mayor: Of course, you're not! Show up around six. I'll have a photographer there.
Yantz: If you don't get these kids out of here right now, I'm pressing charges. 
Fred: But, dad, we have to find out who the creature is, and fast!
Mayor: Why? So you can ruin everything?
Daphne: No, because it said it was going to attack us tomorrow night.
Mayor: Tomorrow night? That's wonderful!
All: What?!
Mayor: I mean, terrible. Awful. Fortunately, I know what to do. Come to the Cicada Festival tomorrow night so we can... protect you! Six o'clock. Well, now. Who wants to go out for cheesecake?
Caddy: Ed, come on, now. Let's go back to the clubhouse. It's getting dark.
Ed Machine: Forget it. I'm having the best game of my life!
Voice: You did not heed my warning. I told you that you-
Ed Machine: Yeah, yeah, quit my job at Destroido or some'in' terrible would happen to me. Listen, you. I'm the CEO of the company, and I am not going anywhere! Now, get lost! 
Ed Machine: That's the way to do it. 
Ed Machine: Huh?
Ed Machine: What? 
Velma: Looks like that cicada thing struck again last night!
Shaggy: And, like, we're next. Tonight! 
Fred: Hey, don't worry. I've got it all figured out. I was up all night building a trap, and believe me, I'll catch it.
Scooby: Or die trying.
Fred: Thanks again, Daph, for agreeing to come here.
Daphne: Oh, Freddy. I wanted to, for you. So, uh, how long do you think we'll be stuck in this trap?
Fred: Well, the cleaning crew usually gets in around nine, so it should only be... twelve hours or so. Hey, can I have a sip of your soda? My throat's starting to close up from the blood rushing to my head. 
Daphne: Oh, Freddy.
