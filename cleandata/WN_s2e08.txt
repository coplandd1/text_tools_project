Yo, yo, what's up, dawgs?
Welcome to Alcatraz!
Hey, anything special going down
in San Francisco tomorrow?
Grind Games!
Yeah, Grind Games Two!
Tomorrow, the world's
best skateboarders
will walk the walk,
so tonight, let's rock the ramp!
How else to get
this party started
than with the skate king
Ryan Scheckler!
'Wow, his signature move!'
'Ryan is ready to
bring it tomorrow.'
Is there any way
our next boarder
Rich Gurman, can top that?
'That's big air!'
Uh...really big air.
boom boom boom
Thanks for inviting us
to San Francisco, Ryan.
No problem.
You're gonna have a great time
at the Grind Games.
Security check, folks.
Uh, sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Scheckler.
That's fine by me.
These events can attract
some really weird dudes.
Ooh.
Wow!
Like, free Swedish massages!
Good-bye stress!
There sure
is a lot of security
for just a skateboarding
tournament.
You didn't hear about
last night's attack?
Attack?
What attack?
Some monster kidnapped a skater
at the opening party.
SCOOBY: Monster?
- Oh, great!
Like, just when
I was stress-free.
Don't worry, guys,
they beefed up security
so no more whack stuff happens.
Well, we'll also keep an eye out
for anything whack.
High on life!
Not on boards!
High on life!
Not on boards..
- You mean like that?
- Don't worry about him.
'That dude is Haze Farlinguini.'
'He runs this freaky group
of street artists'
'called the Red Persons Troupe'
and they juggle
and chant and stuff.
You are all trespassing on
my people's performance area!
You defile our sacred space
with your aggressive boarding
and low-slung trousers.
These Grind Games must stop!
Grind coffee! Not rear axles!
'Oh! Ryan Scheckler completes
a kickflip Indy'
'as time runs out!'
Oh, man.
Ooh, great luck.
That judge must've missed
Ryan's mistake.
Even better luck.
Cotton candy!
Greetings! I'm Julian Dubree,
tour guide for hire.
My personal rickshaw
and boat tours
of San Francisco
are just a buck a minute.
Uh, thanks, friend,
but we're just
here to watch the skateboarding.
It's a little known fact
that the fastest speed
ever recorded on the skateboard
is 63 miles per hour.
That was a freebie.
I'm doing great business
with all these tourists here.
And by the way,
it's a little known fact
the first tourists
came to the city in 1828.
Hey, that's two freebies.
Ohh!
'Lucas is on the course.'
'She's a top contender
for the championship.'
- Ugh-uh.
- Aah!
Ugh!
Aah! Uh.
'Aah!'
That must've been
the same monster
that Ryan described
from last night.
Like, he was wrapped
in more seaweed
than a 6-foot California roll.
It seems to me
like that creature
is targeting
the Grind Games competitors.
That means his next target
could be Ryan.
That monster,
he is the legendary
San Franpsycho!
Roh! Something about that name
gives me a bad feeling.
And I can also tell you
where that monster comes from.
For a dollar.
He comes from right over there.
Alcatraz?
'He was once known
as the prisoner
'Clint Morris.'
It was 1963,
Clint was feared by all
yet he himself feared nothing.
Clint never made it to freedom.
In fact, his right hand
never made it
out of dangerous
San Francisco Bay.
Legend has it
his scar-covered ghost
'known as the San Franpsycho'
still makes his home
in Alcatraz.
Although I am licensed
by the city
to give night tours
of the island
I'm not going in there
with some psycho on the loose!
I'm staying right here
in my boat.
It's a little known fact
that 12%
of all boat owners
live on their boats.
There's a reason some facts
are little known.
How will we ever find
the San Franpsycho
in this huge place?
It won't be hard since
the monster just found us!
Aah!
- Roh!
- Ohh!
- Uhh!
- Unh!
Jinkies! Everyone, come here!
Hey, this cell looks lived in.
Correct. This appears to be
the San Franpsycho's lair.
Look at this
Grind Games program.
There are big red X's through
pictures of the skateboarders,
including Ryan.
Hmm.
Wait a minute,
that's Julian's boat!
Stranded on Alcatraz.
And the San Franpsycho
is off to terrorize Ryan
in the Grind Games.
But where's Julian?
The monster must've done
something to him.
Or maybe Julian is the monster.
All I know is I've never liked
dark nights
on spooky prison islands.
SCOOBY: Me, neither.
No problem, gang.
I suspect that this strange
boat-like shape under this tarp
is really a boat.
Keen logic, Freddy.
I'm setting a course
for the main land.
Fred, that makes the fish
in my sneakers happy.
- Huh?
- Ooh.
Bail!
SCOOBY: Bail! Bail! Woh! Roh!
- We're doomed!
Doomed, I tell you!
Fred, look out
for the rocks up ahead!
Like, those aren't rocks!
Maybe we should've just
stayed at that nice, dark
horribly terrifying prison.
[Scooby-Doo and Shaggy
whimpering]
- Ohh!
- Uhh!
Back up!
And try a breath mint.
We're going to make it.
Ah, irony.
So we meet again.
Ohh!
Aah!
But, Ryan, that creepy beast
is still out there.
Maybe the best idea is to
cancel the Grind Games.
No. These games must go on.
There's a lot of tradition
at stake here.
This is Grind Games Two.
Isn't that Judge Rudy Banyez
over there
in the body painting booth?
Cool! She got a skateboarder
painted on her shoulder.
"Ryan."
Looks like our judge
has a favorite skateboarder.
Well, that sure is suspicious
but any fan of Ryan
wouldn't try to
hurt his chances
in the competition.
It's a little known fact
that the San Franpsycho monster
is actually 13 years old.
Hey, pal.
Remember us?
Four kids and a dog
waving good-bye
from a deserted island
of terror?
Look, the monster
knocked me out, okay?
When I woke up, I was back
at fisherman's wharf
which, by the way, was an active
fishery up until 1977.
You have a knack
for storytelling.
And you are
interrupting my tour.
'Oh! A rare frontside
flip lip slide.'
'Maltby is doubling the best
true competition, baby.'
Three hours
and no sign of the monster.
Hey, Scoob, maybe we scared away
that seaweed psycho.
Rawwrrr!
- We lost him.
- Wait!
I see something.
Hold it right there, Haze.
It's not enough to protest
against the skaters?
Now you want to
sabotage the games?
Young lady, these tools
are for a replacement stage
I am forced to build
for my troupe.
Why? You'll have the space back
once the games are over
and they tear down this vert.
Vert? Vert is not a word
and there is no
vert to enlightenment.
I'm getting a very
suspicious feeling.
Me, too.
That guy's got San Fran
nutball painted all over him.
Guys, I have a new plan.
Let's split up.
- New plan?
- Just let it go.
Uh-h, oh!
Judging by the non-melodic
nature of this music
I think we've got plenty
of time to look for clues
in Haze's RV.
Let's look around.
There has to be something
tying Haze to the monster.
Hmm.
Ha-ha! Good work, Scooby.
These are all fancy costumes.
It proves that Haze could have
made the elaborate costume
the San Franpsycho wears.
It's Haze.
Stop right there!
You're late for the show!
- I'm disappointed in you, Moss.
- Moss?
He thinks we're members
of his performance art group.
Go! Get on stage!
We've got passersby
to enlighten.
Thanks for
inviting me along, guys.
Undercover work is so cool.
What do you call
this maneuver we're doing?
Tiptoeing.
Where would he go?
Over there!
Good work, Ryan.
Don't worry.
I won't lose him again.
I lost him. Ah!
'Hey, we're off the track!'
We have to help Fred
and those innocent passengers.
I've got an idea.
Hop on, Daphne.
Since my wayward artists
have finally shown up
my talented troupe can now
perform our grand finale.
Please let it be
a disappearing act.
The human pyramid!
Why do I even hope anymore?
'Behold.'
What the mighty Egyptians
once termed..
...the pyramid!
SCOOBY: Rikes!
SCOOBY: Too heavy.
Like, be cool, Scoob.
Sorry we're late,
Mr. Haze, dude.
What the blazes?
- Whoa-oh...oh!
- Whoa-oh...oh!
To avoid a crash,
you guys will have to do
a power slide to the left.
Slidy lefty.
Power.. No problem.
Just do what we do.
Phew!
Don't panic.
Just all of you do a tail stop.
Rawwrrr!
10.0, Fred.
Your trick was sick.
We'll talk shop later.
It's monster-chasing time.
The only thing left to do
is capture the San Franpsycho
and I've got a plan.
I'm pretty sure
he'll show up back
at the Grind Games here
to try and harass
'another skateboarder tonight.'
'So, over here, Scooby will
hide behind this obstacle
'and Shaggy will pose
as a competitor.'
Uh-uh. No way!
Not gonna happen.
Bad diagram.
This box of Scooby Snax
says that's a good diagram.
Like, who am I to argue
with a snack box?
SCOOBY: He'll do it.
How will making
Shaggy a competitor
catch the San Franpsycho,
Freddy?
Here's the twist,
when Shaggy and Scooby pass me
I'll activate
a very powerful magnet.
Because of his metal hand
it'll pull the San Franpsycho
towards us.
So that's why you wanted me
to build
a helmet-mounted magnet.
You mean you didn't ask?
I've learned it's best
not to question.
Since it's disguised to look
like a skateboarding helmet
I can blend in with the crowd.
It works.
'What works?'
'Joey, is that you?'
Uh, he'll have to call you back.
Like, you got
any last-second tips?
If you have a choice between
falling on your head
or your rear,
go with your rear.
Hey, ha ha,
like, I'm pretty good at..
Whoa!
Whoa! Ahh!
Whoa-a-a!
Oh! Oh!
Aah! Aah!
Rawwrrr!
Rawwrrr!
Oh! Ooh!
Uhh!
Arrr-ooh!
Oh!
I'm okay!
Rawwrrr!
Rah!
Rawwrrr!
thud
Rawwrrr!
Oh! Ooh!
Ah! Ugh!
Whoa-a-a!
crash
You did it, Scoob.
You trapped the San Franweirdo.
Rudy Banyez!
Like, why would
such a big fan of Ryan
be trying to knock him
out of the competition?
That was my biggest clue.
The San Franpsycho
never actually went after Ryan.
She went after everyone else.
I have to give you meddling kids
perfect scores.
I admit it, okay?
I wanted to sabotage the games
because they wouldn't
let me compete.
But I would never scare Ryan.
He's my idol.
So it was the judge?
That's freaky.
Becoming a judge was the only
way I could join the games
since girls aren't allowed.
What? Girls compete,
Amanda, Zoey.
Zoey ripped it yesterday.
Well, then you tell me
why they wouldn't let me in.
Whoa!
Wait. I-I can get this.
'Whoa! Aah!'
Seriously, I'm good!
Uh, like, I think you
might need some practice.
Say, ten to twenty years of it.
Another amazing run
by Ryan Scheckler.
Let's see
what our judges thought.
SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
