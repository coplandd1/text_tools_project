Shaggy: Like, Hawaii is the place for a vacation.
Scooby: And food!
Shaggy: Yeah, food.
Mr. Simms: Hold it. This will make a good picture for my newspaper.
Shaggy: How's this? This tour you've taken us on is the greatest, Mr. Simms...That is, so far.
Mr Simms: So far?
Shaggy: Sure. Like, visiting that ancient village of a lost tribe tomorrow leaves me cold. And besides, there isn't going to be a luau.
Mr. Simms: But, Shaggy, that isn't part of my tour.
Shaggy: I know. The rest of the gang thought it up.
Mr. Simms: Oh, no. You must not go there. That ancient village is haunted.
Shaggy: Ha ha! H-h-haunted?
Mr. Simms: Not even I would go there.
Shaggy: Then neither will we, right, Scoob?
Scooby: Right, Shag.
Mr. Simms: Smart thinking. Now forget all about ghosts and have a good time.
Scooby: Yeah, yeah.
Shaggy: I'll bet the gang back at the pineapple parlor aren't having as much fun as we are.
Scooby: help!
Shaggy: this way, scoob!
Shaggy: Scooby doo, where are you? Hey, where is everybody? Mr. Simms? Scooby? All gone! Everyone's vanished!
Velma: After 47 luaus in a row, I don't see how shag and scoob Could possibly
handle another one.
Fred: You know those
two... Always hungry.
Daphne: Besides, they're probably
so stuffed, they can't move.
Shaggy: g-g-ghosts!
G-g-ghost drums! Witch doctors!
Daphne: What?
Fred: Shaggy, get ahold of yourself.
Shaggy: Like, ok, but it doesn't help.
Velma: Where's mr. Simms
and scooby doo?
Shaggy: The natives, mr. Simms,
and scooby doo vanished!
Poof!
Fred: Poof? I think
you're full of poi,
But let's go find them.
Velma: shaggy, it's
a scientific fact...
People and scooby
don't just vanish, poof.
Shaggy: Yeah? Like, it's also
a scientific fact
That drums don't play
without drummers.
Velma: Hmm.
Shaggy: So where is everybody?
Velma: I've got an idea. Let's
ask that old man.
Daphne: What old man?
Velma: He's gone!
Fred: see any clues?
Shaggy: No, but I hear one.
Daphne: look!
All: a ghost drum!
Fred: let's evacuate.
Velma: Hey, it's gone.
Fred: then how come the
drumming is getting louder?
Shaggy: yeah!
Shaggy: Ooh! Yikes!
It's there! Ask the ghost drum!
All: zoinks!
Shaggy: scooby doo,
where were you?
Scooby: Hiding.
Shaggy: Hiding? You mean scaring.
Is this any way to
greet your buddies?
Scooby: Better?
Shaggy: Better.
Scooby: Hee hee!
Velma: Well, so much for
scooby's vanishing act.
Fred: Now let's find mr. Simms.
Shaggy: Let's don't. 
Scooby: Right.
Velma: Shame on you two.
After all, he's our host,
And he took us to 47 luaus.
Fred: And there might not be a 48th.
Shaggy: Another luau? Let's go.
Scooby: Right!
Fred: Hmm. Not a single clue.
Velma: look on the ground.
Shaggy: all I see is dirt.
Velma: a struggle
took place here.
and there's where
somebody was dragged away.
Fred: and that somebody
must have been mr. Simms.
Velma: Let's follow it.
Velma: Come on!
Velma: Hold it!
Shaggy: first ghosts,
now litterbugs.
Hmm. A newspaper article
written by john simms.
His article tells about
villagers being terrorized
By a ghostly
legend come to life...
Mano tiki tia.
Now he's investigating to see
If the ghosts have really
come back to haunt the islands.
Fred: Looks like we've got
Another mystery on our hands.
Velma: And the first thing to do
Is find mr. Simms.
And I bet he's in
that ancient village.
That's a perfect
place for ghosts.
Shaggy: Oh, who wants to find
an old haunted village?
Scooby: Not us.
Fred: Oh, yes, you do.
Shaggy: Like, no way!
Besides, those tracks
stop at the jungle.
Velma: We can follow
them in the jungle,
Thanks to scooby's
keen tracking nose.
Scooby: who? Me?
Scooby: What nose?
Fred: Too bad. This scooby
snack smells delicious.
Shaggy: A scooby snack?
Scooby: Hey!
Velma: sorry, scoob.
You had your chance.
Scooby: Hm!
Shaggy: Zoinks!
Heh heh heh heh!
Scooby: bats.
Shaggy: yeah, bats.
Shaggy: Zoinks!
Scooby: Hey, look out!
Shaggy: Look out? Like, all I
can see are your paws.
Velma: Sorry, guys.
It looks like I've not
only lost shag and scoob,
But us, too.
Daphne: So how will we ever find
them or the haunted village?
Velma: Any ideas, fred?
Fred: Not yet,
But something will hit me.
Velma: Wow! Now where is this?
Shaggy: Hey, give a look
up. Maybe it's a clue.
Velma: It's mano tiki tia.
Fred: Well, thanks to shag and scooby,
We found the haunted village.
Velma: it looks too
creepy to be real.
Shaggy: like, it's
real, all right.
Fred: Let's have a look.
Shaggy: zoinks! 
Velma: Come on! Let's get out of here!
Velma: Whew! We lost him.
Daphne: What next?
Shaggy: Hey, daph, did you
have to say that?
Hey, fred, velma, and daph
are still in that creepy place.
And I wish we were, too.
Velma: What is this place?
Fred: I don't know,
And I don't think I
want to find out.
Daphne: Hey, guys. Shaggy
and scooby got out.
Velma: Then this must be the way out.
Fred: Well?
Velma: It won't budge.
There must be another way out.
Daphne: Ok. Let's find it.
Shaggy: Hey, let us in before...
Scooby: Over there!
Shaggy: Oh, no! And me without
even my slingshot!
Like, I guess a club will do.
Ok, spooky! Come and get it!
Zoinks!
Scooby: yike!
Scooby: Uh!
Fred: We'll need a torch. Shh!
Daphne: Shh!
She's... She's disappeared!
Fred: Now we have to find Mr. Simms, shaggy, scooby, and velma.
Daphne: Look, fred.
It might be a way out.
Fred: Or a way in... To more danger.
Velma: Wow! Oh, no!
It's mr. Simms' hat.
They've got him!
But they're not going to get me.
Velma: ah... Ah...
Ah...
Ah-choo!
Shaggy: Come on, scoob.
Like, you're not really
Afraid of ghosts, are you?
Scooby: Uh-huh.
Man: mano tiki tia!
Shaggy: Like, who said that?
Scooby: Not me.
Man: aargh!
Shaggy: well, that answers that.
Man: Aargh!
Scooby: yike!
Man: Yaah!
Shaggy: Zoinks!
Whew! Thanks, velma.
Like, in another moment,
That freaky tiki would
have made poi out of this boy.
Scooby: Me, too.
Velma: We're still not
safe, so let's split.
Shaggy: But old terrible
tiki is after us.
Velma: Not only him, but also the...
Scooby: Witch doctor.
Velma: Right, scoob, the witch doctor,
But how did you know?
Shaggy: zoinks!
Witch doctor: Aargh!
Shaggy: Let's barricade the door!
Come on, velma.
Shaggy: Like, thanks.
Scooby: Huh?
Velma: Oh, no!
Shaggy: What's the matter?
Uh-oh.
Witch doctor: Aargh!
Velma: have a seat, doc.
Fred: shag? Velma?Scooby doo?
Daphne: fred, there's
nobody here but us.
Shaggy: Aaah! Like, me tarzan. This jane.
Velma: Yeah. Me jane.
Shaggy: him cheetah the chimp.
Shaggy: You look for boy, girl, and dog?
Witch doctor: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Shaggy: like, they went that-a way.
Witch doctor: Aargh!
Shaggy: Whew!
Velma: It worked! What a lucky break.
Shaggy: Like, some lucky break!
Fred: Shh!
Daphne: What did you see?
Fred: Something on that table.
Daphne: Oyster shells and pearls.
This is a real clue!
Fred: You're right.
And now all we have
to do is find everybody
And solve the
mystery of mano tiki tia.
This way.
Shaggy: Oh, my feet are killing me.
Velma: It's a good thing
We slipped the witch doctor,
Or that wasn't all
That would be getting k*lled.
Shaggy: Like, I'm too whacked to walk.
Scooby: Oh, boy!
Let's fly.
Look!
Shaggy: hey! An airplane!
Like, it must have
crashed here years ago.
Velma: I don't think so.
Shaggy: What about all those vines?
Velma: Plastic and definitely a clue.
Skeleton: Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Shaggy: It's a skinny spooky.
Velma: No, shag. It's not real.
Look at your foot.
See? It's a trip wire.
Shaggy: Yeah. It sure tripped me.
Velma: Yes, but it also operated
that fake skeleton...
And look what scooby found...
A tape recorder that
made the skeleton laugh.
Shaggy: Like, I sure fell
for that trick.
Velma: Naturally. But I
wonder why anyone
Would make such an
elaborate setup like this.
Shaggy: Beats me, but I'm going
to have the last laugh.
Hey, skinny, do you know why
The skeleton went
to the library?
Hee hee! To bone
up on a few things.
See? I got the last laugh.
Ha ha ha!
Skeleton: Ha ha ha ha!
Shaggy: Yow!
Uh!
Daphne: we were hoping
we'd bump into you guys.
Fred: Yeah, but not so hard.
Shaggy: That's togetherness. Ha ha ha!
Fred: with all the
clues we found so far,
The mystery is starting
to piece together.
Velma: Except we still
haven't found mr. Simms.
Scooby: Footprints!
Velma: scooby's
right. Footprints...
And they're fresh.
Shaggy: Wonder where they go.
Daphne: Let's follow them. 
Fred: Come on.
Aargh!
Fred: Whoever he is, get him!
Shaggy: I forgot my swim
fins, but here goes!
Velma: a secret cavern.
Fred: that is the
way out... I hope.
Velma: A secret entrance
to the village.
Fred: Yeah, but where
did the old man go?
Daphne: Who is that old man?
Witch doctor: Foolish mortals!
You have returned
To face the wrath
of mano tiki tia!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Daphne: We're trapped!
Shaggy: Like, what do we do?
Fred: I say we get out of here.
Daphne: Brilliant!
Man: aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Scooby: Hee hee hee!
Hee hee hee!
Witch doctor: Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Yike!
Daphne: what is that?
Shaggy: whoops!
Shaggy: Wow!
Scooby: We did it!
Shaggy: We certainly did, scooby.
Velma: It's sure strange
the witch doctor
Could get shook up
by a jungle creature.
Fred: Right. That's my plan,
to shake him up a lot.
Daphne: What's the action?
Fred: First we've got to get
That trick amusement park mirror
From the mystery machine.
Now we hide it in
the jungle like this.
Next, scooby and shaggy play ghost drums To lure the witch doctor here.
Shaggy: Right. Like, we're experts.
Fred: Then when the witch doctor
sees his image in the mirror,
He runs down the trail
and plops right into
The giant pit we
covered with palm leaves,
And bingo! We capture
the witch doctor
And solve the mystery.
Shaggy: stop clowning,
scoob. It's time for spooking.
Scooby: Ok.
Shaggy: Hey, scoob. Pick up the beat.
Shaggy: What you crying about? Zoinks!
Witch doctor: Ha ha ha!
Shaggy: Yike!
Another witch doctor!
Statue: Aargh!
Witch doctor: Aah!
Shaggy: hang on, scoob!
Shaggy: Well, what do you know?
We got him.
Witch doctor: yah! Agh!
Fred: Now for the unmasking.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Mr. John simms?!
Shaggy: But what is a mano tiki tia?
Velma: See, shaggy. It's
like a parade float
Operated by mr. Simms' henchmen.
Fred: Now all the clues add up.
Simms engineered this hoax.
Their plan was to scare
The fishing villagers away
So they could poach
their pearl beds.
Right, mr. Simms?
Mr. Simms: I'm not talking!
Fred: Then he'd come here
to the haunted village
Because nobody would
dare to follow ghosts.
Shaggy: But he was at the luau with us.
Velma: no. It was his pal
disguised as the witch doctor.
Daphne: What about the
mysterious old man?
Mysterious old man: Perhaps I can answer that.
Lieutenant tomoro,
hawaii police department.
I was on the trail of
these pearl poachers
For a long time, but
thanks to you kids...
Shaggy: Ahem!
Lt Tomorow: And you, too, scooby doo...
Things got wrapped
up in a hurry.
Daphne: Oh, well. We still
have one more day
Of our vacation left.
Lt Tomoro: And that day will be on me.
Scooby: Yahoo!
Shaggy: Oh, no!
Scooby doo, come
back here with my poi!
Scooby: Yum, yum, yum!
Scooby: scooby doo!
