Get out!
Unh!
So, like, tell me
where we're goin' again?
'We're going to visit my uncle'
'the Count von Jones.'
He lives in a giant
abandoned castle
and it's surrounded
by a creepy forest
and it's just across
the street from a factory
that makes specialty coffins.
Like, we're not even
waiting for the monsters
to find us anymore, are we?
Hey, gang, look at this.
SCOOBY: Ooh, dog show, dog show.
Hey, yeah, that's
the International Dog Show.
It's goin' on all weekend.
That looks fun.
But what about my uncle?
Well, I say for once,
we do what Scooby wants to do.
Okay, Scooby, it's up to you.
A dark, spooky castle
or a nice, cozy dog show?
SCOOBY: Uh, let's see.
SCOOBY: Uh, Dog show.
Okay, so I guess
we'll just have to miss
the antique torture exhibit
at my uncle's museum.
- Perfect.
- No problem.
The International Dog Show.
Such perfect hair.
I'm almost jealous.
I'm almost starved.
How 'bout you, Scoob?
SCOOBY: Yeah.
Huh?
Hey, I know her.
That's my friend, Meadow.
Hey, Meadow!
Shaggy? Whoa!
How are you?
Hey, careful, Scoob,
that's not your bag, man.
I see you've met,
M'lady Moonbeam of Monterey.
My future grand champion.
Yes, you're gonna be.
That's right,
little poochie-woochie. Mm.
It sure has been a while.
Yeah, I know.
I got kind of sidetracked
watching this
really cool cloud.
Well, this sure looks like
one great dog show.
Well, then, I guess
you haven't heard?
Heard what, Meadow?
About the cat creature.
Cat creature?
Yeah.
They say it's huge.
It can pounce on you
from anywhere
and it rips stuff
to like, shreds
'with these razor-like claws!'
It's been terrorizing
the event.
They might even
cancel the dog show.
That's terrible.
Well, I guess
my uncle's castle's
lookin' pretty good
right about now, huh?
Well, gang, it looks like
we've got a mystery
to solve.
Yeah, we'd better be
on the lookout
for any fiercely-fanged
felines.
'You're gonna stay?'
Well, you sure are brave.
Oh, wow! Purple.
- Whoa.
- Wow.
Yeah, I should charge admission.
You must be, like,
the best dog groomer ever, huh?
Aw, don't try
to butter me up, kid.
I don't give out freebies.
Unless, of course,
you want a snip there, handsome.
Uh, thanks. No.
I kinda like
my natural look.
You cut hair for people, too?
That's my dream.
But so far,
no one will hire me.
They say I'm only good
with dogs.
Well, you sure are
good at this.
This? Ha!
This is nothing!
That's my real star
over there, Chrissy.
'She's the defending world
champion golden retriever.'
Uh, who are you?
Oh, I'm Chrissy's owner,
Mr. B.
'Meet Maize, Flax,
Jingle, Knox, 14-Carat'
'and of course, Bling Bling.'
Sounds like
some kind of rap group.
Well, I call them
the "Secret 6" for short.
'Because they were pretty much
a secret till they got here.'
'Yeah, one day all six
could be grand champions.'
You must be proud
of Chrissy, Mr. B.
Aw, I sure am.
'The International Dog Show
is about to begin.'
Gentlemen, start your canines!
Oh, no,
it's the cat creature!
Heh.
Hmm?
SCOOBY: Huh?
Unh!
Grrrh!
You know we can't leave
an eyewitness.
Man, I'd hate to see the size
of that cat creature's
litter box.
All six of Chrissy's pups
are missing.
Don't worry, Mr. B.
We'll help you
find the puppies.
And capture
that cat creature.
Scoob, there you are,
old buddy, old friend, old pal.
Where's your collar?
What's the matter with you,
Scooby-Doo?
Cat creature got your tongue?
It's the puppies we wanted,
not this stupid mutt.
Don't worry, boy,
we've got plans for you.
Hey, look, a toupee
for a hairless Chihuahua.
Ha! It's just
some fur I found.
I wanted to show you guys,
but then I got caught up
on how it shimmers
in the light.
Shimmer. Shimmer.
Uh, sorry to bum
your shimmer.
Cat fur.
Could be a clue.
Oh, I hate to think
of those poor little
puppies out there
with that cat creature
on the prowl.
Don't worry, Daphne.
We'll split up
and look for clues.
Split up? With that
terrible tabby on the loose?
Oh, I vote no way.
Uh-uh, oh, no!
And so does Scoob.
Looks like you're
outvoted, Shaggy.
We'll go up and check out
the sound booth.
You guys can take
the unpatrolled
dimly-lit parking structure.
Scoob, you don't mind
splittin' up?
Quiet!
'Why do I hate dogs?'
Now we sit tight
for our signal from the boss.
'Hm.'
What is it with you
and those stupid gadgets?
Look, you don't complain
when I make all that
cool spy-stuff for you.
Shh.
Shh!
SCOOBY: One, two, three, four, five.
SCOOBY: One, two, three, four, five.
SCOOBY: Huh? Huh?
Nothin' down here
to frighten anybody.
Especially nothin'
cat-like. Huh.
No siree.
Yikes!
Scooby, you're supposed
to jump in my arms
like you always do when we see
terrifying creatures.
It's only a kitty.
I knew that.
Scoob, chill, man!
This is so not like you.
What was that?
What?
Aah! Oh.
The dogs are gone!
Funny how our footsteps
echo so loud in this place.
Especially when
we're not walkin' anymore.
Let's make a dash
for the exit tunnel.
Aah!
Huh?
Come on, Scooby!
The cat creature's
here somewhere!
I get it. Fear has messed
with your mind.
Maybe these will
set you right.
Scooby snacks, jalapeno
and applesauce blend.
- 'The best.'
- Yuck!
Like, something's wrong here.
Very wrong.
'We lost them
in those woods.'
Boss, slight change in plans.
The Secret 6 escaped.
'Escaped?'
Well, not for long.
'Don't worry,
we won't lose them.'
No sign of that
pernicious pussycat.
But look what I found.
It's a one-of-a-kind
burlap-like fabric.
Two of a kind.
'It looks like
this scrap I picked up'
'near Chrissy's kennel.'
It's just as I suspected.
Those pups aren't lost,
they were dognapped.
And I'm willing to bet
the cat creature
was a diversion.
Hey, gang, have I got
a news flash for you.
This isn't the real
Scooby-Doo.
He barked at a cat,
he wagged at fear
he "yucked" at a Scooby Snack
and he growled at me.
Looks like Scooby
to me, Shaggy.
Guys, trust me on this.
If there are
two things I know
they are Scooby-Doo!
You do the math.
You're just on edge.
We'll all feel better
when we've found that--
Oops! Heh.
Sorry, Scoob.
You're right, Shaggy.
This is not Scooby.
But then,
where's the real Scooby-Doo?
What if he was taken
with the six missing pups?
Zoinks! He could be
in real trouble!
Scooby-Doo, where are you?!
Where the heck could they be?
Where the heck could they be?
Jinkies! They must have
fallen into the river.
Shine more light
over here, Freddy.
Wow, I didn't know
we had ultra-high beams.
We don't.
Someone else does.
They're in the river.
Let's get 'em.
We're not the only ones
searching for Scooby.
Huh!
Here, poochies.
Come to Uncle Scar.
SCOOBY: Huh?
Aah!
Hmm?
Aah!
Oh, look at the puppies.
A cell phone?
Where'd you find this,
Scooby?
Don't let go of those rocks.
Don't let go of me.
I have a good idea
who's behind all this.
We've got to get back
to the dog show.
It fell for our phony
fuse-box trap.
You were saying?
'So that explains the creature's
jumping ability.'
Those dognappers answer
to their boss.
The cat creature
or should I say
'This is Meadow.
Leave a message.'
Meadow?
But, like, why?
I hired those thugs
to snatch Chrissy's pups.
I didn't want them
to grow up and compete
with my precious,
M'lady Moonbeam.
And look, the dognapper's sack
is just like Meadow's
burlap handbag.
I never meant for things
to go this far.
If it weren't for you
meddling kids
the cat creature would have
just crept away.
Along with six stolen puppies.
How could you do this
to me and Scooby, Meadow?
I thought you were
our friend.
Sorry, Shaggy,
M'lady Moonbeam comes first.
Don't you, my little
princess-wincess?
Yes, you do.
Looks like you'll need that
stylin' new do after all.
- Hold still.
- No, really.
I don't think it,
I, uh..
Well, I guess I can always
wear my football helmet
to the beach.
Okay, who's next?
I'd like to make one very
special announcement, everyone.
Thanks to the incredible valor
of Scooby-Doo.
Chrissy's puppies are all safe!
And I've just been told that
we have a new best-in-show
His Honorable Scooby-Doobus
'of Shagsmans Fields.'
SCOOBY: Huh?
Also known as Scooby-Doo.
'That's my Scooby!'
- Old buddy, old pal.
- Scooby-Doo.
SCOOBY: Scooby-Dooby.
Doo!
