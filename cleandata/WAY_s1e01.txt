WHAT A NERVOUS NIGHT
TO BE WALKING HOME FROM
THE MOVIES, SCOOBY-DOO,
AND ALL BECAUSE YOU
HAD TO STAY AND SEE
 STAR, DOG RANGER OF
THE NORTH WOODS TWICE.
SCOOBY: YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S C-C-COMING FROM THE BUSHES.
GO SEE WHAT IT IS, SCOOBY.
DON'T WORRY. I'M
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
SCOOBY: THANKS A LOT.
SCOOBY: OH, WELL.
SCOOBY: HUH?
SCOOBY: RUFF! RUFF! RUFF! RUFF!
SCOOBY: RUFF! RUFF! RUFF! RUFF!
SCOOBY, COME BACK! WAIT!
SCOOBY: RUFF! RUFF! RUFF!
SCOOBY: HUH? WHERE DID HE
GO? WHERE DID HE GO?
LIKE, NEXT TIME, SIGNAL.
SCOOBY: SORRY.
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?
LOOKS LIKE A DESERTED
TYPE PICKUP TRUCK.
ANYONE HOME?
YOU'RE RIGHT, SHAGGY.
THIS SURE IS STRANGE.
YEAH. WHAT'S AN EMPTY
OLD SUIT OF ARMOR DOING
IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT OF THIS PICKUP?
MAYBE HE WENT OUT
FOR THE KNIGHT, GET IT?
VERY FUNNY!
GOSH, I WONDER WHO
THIS CREEPY HUNK
OF TIN BELONGS TO.
WELL, THE NAME
ON THE CRATE SAYS,
"JAMESON HYDE WHITE,
PROFESSOR OF ARCHEOLOGY,
LONDON, ENGLAND."
SCOOBY: HYDE WHITE?
I'VE HEARD OF
HIDE-AND-SEEK BEFORE,
BUT I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF HYDE WHITE.
THAT'S AN ENGLISH
NAME, YOU COMEDIANS.
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S A DELIVERY LABEL THAT SAYS,
"DELIVER TO THE COUNTY MUSEUM."
SO THAT'S WHERE THE OLD KNIGHT
WAS HEADED FOR.
THAT'S USING THE OLD NOODLE.
BUT, LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO OUR MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR?
WELL, IF HE WAS
DRIVING THIS TRUCK,
HE'S DISAPPEARED.
WELL, GANG, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE UP TO OUR ARMOR-PLATES
IN ANOTHER MYSTERY.
OH, DEAR, OH, DEAR.
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD THANK YOU
FOR FINDING THE BLACK KNIGHT,
BUT WITH PROFESSOR HYDE WHITE'S
MYSTERIOUS
DISAPPEARANCE AND ALL,
I WISH YOU HADN'T.
WHY IS THAT, MR. WICKLES?
BECAUSE OF THE LEGEND.
Fred: LEGEND?
YES. THE BLACK KNIGHT
IS SUPPOSED TO COME
ALIVE WHEN THE MOON IS FULL.
LIKE, WOW! THE MOON
WAS FULL LAST NIGHT.
THEN WHAT WAS THE
PROFESSOR DOING
WITH TALL, TIN,
DARK, AND CREEPY?
HE WAS DELIVERING
IT TO THE MUSEUM,
ALL THE WAY FROM ENGLAND.
WHERE DO YOU
WANT IT, MR. WICKLES?
OH, JUST PUT IT IN
THE MEDIEVAL ROOM.
RIGHT.
SCOOBY: HUH?
SCOOBY: WHAT'S THIS? HMM...
Daphne: SCOOBY-DOO,
WHERE ARE YOU?
Fred: COME ON,
SCOOBY, WE'RE LEAVING.
SCOOBY: COMING.
Velma: THIS MYSTERY'S
GOT ME BAFFLED.
WELL, IT'S GOT ME, LIKE, HUNGRY.
WHEN DO WE EAT?
SCOOBY: LET'S EAT!
HEY, WHAT'S SCOOBY WEARING?
Velma: THEY LOOK LIKE
SOME CRAZY KIND OF GLASSES.
Fred: HE MUST HAVE FOUND
THEM AT THE MUSEUM.
SCOOBY: YEAH, YEAH.
MAN, I WONDER WHAT
KIND OF GROOVY THINGS
YOU SEE WITH THOSE.
WELL, THERE'S ONE
WAY TO FIND OUT.
HERE IT IS.
THEY'RE A SPECIAL TYPE
OF MAGNIFYING GLASSES
USED BY JEWELERS,
SCIENTISTS, AND ARCHEOLOGISTS.
AND HOLD ON TO
YOUR HULA-HOOPS...
IT SAYS HERE "MADE
ONLY IN ENGLAND."
ARCHEOLOGISTS?
ENGLAND?
All: PROFESSOR HYDE WHITE!
THAT SETTLES IT.
THERE'S SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON
IN THAT MUSEUM.
SCOOBY: MUSEUM?
RIGHT, SCOOB, TONIGHT
WE'RE GOING FISHING.
THIS PLACE IS LOCKED
UP TIGHTER THAN A DRUM.
THEN, LIKE, HOW DO WE GET IN?
EASY. SHAGGY GOES THROUGH
THAT WINDOW UP THERE.
WHY ME?
BECAUSE THAT'S A SMALL WINDOW,
AND YOU'RE THE THINNEST.
OH, BOY.
COME ON, GIVE ME A
HAND WITH THIS LADDER.
Daphne: IT WON'T REACH.
Velma: I GUESS WE DON'T GET IN.
WELL, IF WE DON'T GET IN,
WE'LL NEVER FIND
OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MISSING PROFESSOR.
SHAGGY, YOU START UP,
AND I'LL GET THE JACK OUT OF
THE MYSTERY MACHINE.
RIGHT.
HANG ON, SHAGGY.
LIKE, RIGHT, MAN.
I'LL START CRANKING.
AND I'LL KEEP HANGING ON.
THAT'S IT. NO MORE JACK.
HE STILL CAN'T REACH IT.
DON'T WORRY.
SHAGGY'S THE SWINGINGEST
GYMNAST IN SCHOOL.
WHEN YOU GET IN,
OPEN THE BACK DOOR.
RIGHT. WATCH ME SWING RIGHT IN.
WELL, AT LEAST WE
KNOW HE'S INSIDE.
THE BLACK KNIGHT.
SURE GLAD IT'S EMPTY.
GOLLY, THIS PLACE
SURE IS CREEPY AT NIGHT.
IT'S EVEN CREEPY DURING THE DAY.
I THINK WE'D BETTER SPLIT UP.
DAPHNE AND I'LL GO THIS WAY.
YOU TWO GO THAT WAY.
AND, SCOOBY, STAND GUARD.
SCOOBY: UH-UH! UH-UH!
WOULD YOU DO IT
FOR A SCOOBY SNACK?
SCOOBY: HMM... TWO?
OK, TWO IT IS.
SCOOBY: RUFF!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
SCOOBY: OH... YIKES!
I THINK WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED.
YEAH. BY SCOOBY.
HEY!
WOW-WEE!
ALL RIGHT, SCOOBY-DOO,
YOU CAN COME WITH US.
SCOOBY: WHOO-EE!
ALL RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN!
DOWN! DOWN!
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?
YOU KNOW HOW THAT FULL MOON
TURNS ON THAT BLACK KNIGHT.
THAT'S ONLY A
SUPERSTITIOUS LEGEND.
WELL, I'M NOT
TAKING ANY CHANCES.
SCOOBY: I'M WITH YOU.
OH, NO! WE LOST SHAGGY!
SCOOBY: UH-OH.
I HOPE WE FIND SHAGGY SOON.
SHH! STOP THAT NOISE!
I'VE GOT IT.
THAT'S BETTER.
COME ON.
WHAT A SPOOKY PLACE.
NOT NOW, SCOOBY. NOT NOW.
OH!
HEY!
NOW LOOK WHAT THAT DOG DID.
HE KNOWS I CAN'T SEE
WITHOUT MY GLASSES.
ARRGH!
OH, THERE YOU ARE, SHAGGY.
YOU SOUND TERRIBLE.
ARRGH!
I TOLD YOU TO TAKE
CARE OF THAT COLD.
AARGH!
LUCKY I BROUGHT YOUR MEDICINE.
I CAN'T FIND THAT
VELMA NOWHERES.
ZOINKS!
THIS WILL FIX YOU UP IN A JIFFY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
SEE? YOU SOUND BETTER 
SCOOBY: HUH? HUH? 
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO!
ARRGH!
SCOOBY: SORRY! BYE-BYE!
ARRGH!
I TELL YOU, THE
BLACK KNIGHT IS ALIVE
AND ROAMING
THROUGH THE HALLWAYS.
IF WE COULD ONLY FIND A CLUE.
Velma: IT'S SCOOBY!
WHEN VELMA SAID CLUE,
SHE DIDN'T MEAN YOU, SCOOBY.
HEY, LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S A PICTURE
MISSING FROM THE WALL.
MAYBE THAT'S A CLUE.
WE BETTER TELL THE OTHERS.
SCOOBY: RIGHT!
IT'S RIGHT DOWN HERE.
THERE'S NO PICTURE
MISSING, SHAGGY.
WELL, IT WAS A MINUTE AGO.
SOME CLUE.
WELL, IF THAT'S BLOOD...
THAT'S A CLUE.
IT'S PAINT. AND LOOK...
A TRAIL OF IT LEADS
DOWN THE HALLWAY.
COME ON, FOLLOW THAT PAINT.
THE TRAIL OF PAINT ENDS
HERE AT THE MUMMY CASE.
COME ON, SHAGGY,
HELP ME OPEN IT.
UH, DON'T LIKE SURPRISES,
ESPECIALLY SPOOKY ONES.
OH, COME ON.
HEY, LOOK, A SECRET ROOM.
Shaggy: SOMEBODY SURE
IS A MESSY HOUSEKEEPER.
Daphne: AND LOOK AT THAT.
THERE ARE 2 PAINTINGS
EXACTLY ALIKE.
Velma: ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?
RIGHT, VELMA.
THIS JUST ABOUT
SOLVES THE MYSTERY.
SCOOBY: IT DOES?
WH-WH-WHAT?
NO TIME TO EXPLAIN NOW, SHAGGY.
WE GOTTA GET THE SHERIFF.
LET'S TAKE THIS BACK WAY OUT.
ARRGH!
LEAVE IT TO DAPHNE TO
PICK THE WRONG DOOR.
ARRGH!
ZOINKS!
ARRGH!
SCOOBY, LIKE, DO SOMETHING.
ARRGH!
ARRGH!
MAYBE MY VENTRILOQUISM BIT
CAN GET US OUT OF THIS JAM.
IF I CAN THROW MY VOICE
TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE
IT'S COMING FROM THE ROOM,
HE MIGHT LEAVE.
HELP! LET ME OUT OF THIS POT!
HELP!
SCOOBY: HELP!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
ARRGGH!
ZOINKS! SCOOBY!
SCOOBY: YIKES!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
WE DID IT, SCOOBY-DOO.
WE DID IT.
SCOOBY: WE DID?
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
Fred: JUST AS WE THOUGHT!
Daphne: IT'S THE
CURATOR, MR. WICKLES.
WE'VE GOT TO
HAND IT TO YOU KIDS.
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE
SUSPECTED WICKLES
AS THE ART SWINDLER.
BOY, IT WAS A NEAT SETUP.
HE AND HIS GANG WERE SWITCHING
THEIR FAKE PIECES OF ART
FOR THE REAL ONES IN THE MUSEUM.
AND THEY MADE THE FAKES AT NIGHT
IN A SECRET WORKSHOP
BEHIND THE MUMMY CASE.
THAT'S WHY THEY HAD
TO GET RID OF THE PROFESSOR.
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO COULD HAVE
SPOTTED THE FAKES.
OH, MY GOSH,
PROFESSOR HYDE WHITE!
WE NEVER FOUND HIM.
Shaggy: IT'S SCOOBY-DOO
WITH A SHOE.
SCOOBY: FOLLOW ME!
SCOOBY: SEE!
All: PROFESSOR HYDE WHITE!
AND ALL THE TIME IT WAS WICKLES
WHO MADE THAT BLACK
KNIGHT COME TO LIFE.
THEN THERE WAS NO LEGEND.
POSITIVELY NOT.
WICKLES JUST USED THE STORY
TO COVER UP MY
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.
SOMEHOW HE MANAGED
TO GET INTO THE ARMOR
DOWN AT THE TRAIN STATION.
AND, LIKE, ON THE
WAY TO THE MUSEUM,
HE MADE YOU DISAPPEAR.
ZOINKS! HE'S ALIVE!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY-DOO!
