HERE WE ARE. WOLF'S END LODGE.
LIKE, IT EVEN
SOUNDS LIKE A WOLF!
THAT A WOLF, SILLY.
Daphne: WOW! WHAT A
RUN-DOWN AND CREEPY PLACE
FOR A WEEKEND OF SKIING.
I KNOW,
BUT IT'S THE ONLY
PLACE WE COULD FIND.
COME ON. LET'S GO IN.
WELCOME TO WOLF'S END LODGE.
HEH HEH HEH!
WE HAVE ALL THE
COMFORTS OF HOME.
YEAH? WHOSE HOME? DRACULA'S?
IT'S COLD OUT THERE.
EXCUSE ME FOR INTERRUPTING,
BUT COULD YOU PUT THIS SUITCASE
IN A SAFE PLACE FOR
ME, MR. GREENWAY?
HEH HEH HEH!
CERTAINLY. CERTAINLY.
NICE DOGGIE. HEH HEH HEH!
NICE DOGGIE. HEH HEH HEH!
HEE HEE HEE!
WHO'S THAT?
THAT'S MR. LEECH, ANOTHER GUEST.
HEH HEH HEH!
NOW, IF YOU WILL BE SO KIND,
I'LL SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOMS.
THIS IS THE YOUNG LADIES' ROOM.
THE OTHER ROOMS
ARE ACROSS THE HALL,
AND, UH, OH, YES. A
WORD OF WARNING...
BE SURE TO LOCK YOUR
DOORS AND WINDOWS
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.
HEH HEH HEH!
LOCK OUR DOORS AND WINDOWS? WHY?
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
THE SNOW GHOST WILL GET YOU.
HEH HEH HEH!
AND TURN YOU INTO GHOSTS!
HEH HEH HEH!
All: SNOW GHOST?
TURN INTO GHOSTS?
SCOOBY: GHOSTS?
WELL, IT'S TIME TO TURN IN.
BEFORE WE GO, WE'LL MAKE SURE
THE WINDOWS ARE ALL LOCKED.
I'LL CHECK IT.
IT'S LOCKED.
AAH!
ZOINKS! THE SNOW GHOST!
Fred: RUN!
Shaggy: LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
COME ON! GANGWAY!
Velma: HANG ON!
THAT SNOW GHOST IS
FOR REAL, ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF
THOSE FOOTPRINTS.
NOW WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO,
FREDDY?
GET A COUPLE OF SNOWCARS
AND FOLLOW THOSE TRACKS.
I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT
OUR MYSTERIOUS GUEST.
OH, BOY!
THIS SKI TRIP'S TURNING
INTO A REAL SCARE TRIP.
BOY, THAT SNOW GHOST
SURE GETS AROUND.
WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA! WHOA!
THE TRACKS END AT
THE EDGE OF THIS CHASM.
WELL, IF HE TRIED
TO WALK ACROSS,
THE FIRST STEP IS A DOOZIE!
Velma: THE SNOW GHOST!
Fred: AND HE CAN FLY!
DUCK!
THERE HE GOES,
FLYING ACROSS THE SKY.
HE DISAPPEARED
BEHIND THOSE TREES.
AND THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE GOING. COME ON!
THIS IS WHERE HE WENT.
BUT NO SNOW GHOST.
LOOK. THERE'S A CAVE
WITH A LIGHT COMING FROM IT.
Shaggy: MAYBE THAT'S
WHERE HE LIVES.
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
GO SEE IF HE'S HOME, SCOOB.
SCOOBY: ME?
Velma: SURE.
YOU CAN RUN THE
FASTEST IF HE'S THERE.
NOW CUT THAT OUT.
SCOOBY: MY LEG! OH! MY LEG! OH!
HEE HEE HEE!
OH, BROTHER!
SCOOBY: HUH?
SCOOBY: UH-OH!
SCOOB SAYS THE COAST IS CLEAR.
COME ON!
WHAT A STRANGE CAVE.
YEAH. LIKE, FURNISHED
IN EARLY CHINATOWN.
THIS STUFF ISN'T
FROM CHINA, SHAGGY.
IT'S FROM TIBET.
WELL, IT'S FOR SURE
THE SNOW GHOST
DOESN'T LIVE HERE.
Shaggy: THEN WHO DOES?
SCOOBY: HMM!
MAYBE IF WE RING THIS GONG,
WE'LL FIND OUT.
WHO DARES ENTER THE
TEMPLE OF FU LAN CHI?
SCOOBY: YIKES!
I KNOW THIS SOUNDS SILLY,
BUT WE WERE
FOLLOWING A SNOW GHOST.
YEAH, AND WE THOUGHT
HE MIGHT HAVE COME IN HERE.
LIKE, I DON'T THINK
HE BELIEVES US.
I KNOW YOU SPEAK THE TRUTH,
FOR I AM THE ONE THE
SNOW GHOST SEEKS.
YOU? YOU?
YES.
MANY YEARS AGO IN TIBET,
I CAME FACE-TO-FACE WITH A BEAST
KNOWN AS THE YETI.
I LEAPED ACROSS A WIDE GORGE
TO THE SAFETY OF A NARROW LEDGE.
BUT I HAD NOT SEEN
THE LAST OF HIM,
FOR HIS GHOST RETURNED
TO SEEK REVENGE.
AND I WAS FORCED
TO FLEE FOR MY LIFE.
AND NOW, AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS OF HIDING,
HE HAS FOUND ME ONCE AGAIN.
ZOINKS! IT'S THE SNOW GHOST!
DO NOT BE ALARMED.
IT IS ONLY THE
WHITE TIMBER WOLF.
WHITE TIMBER WOLF?
YES. HE'S MY FRIEND.
I FEED HIM, AND HE PROTECTS ME.
ALL HE WANTS IS HIS BONE.
SCOOBY: BONE?
HEE HEE HEE!
HEE HEE HEE!
I HAVE A HUNCH THIS SNOW GHOST
IS AFTER SOMETHING BESIDES YOU,
AND WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT WHAT IT IS.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY
MR. CHI TOLD US?
WELL, RIGHT NOW, IT'S
THE ONLY STORY WE HAVE.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE! STOP!
THERE'S SOME MORE
OF THE SNOW GHOST'S FOOTPRINTS.
AND LOOK!
THEY'RE COVERED WITH SAWDUST.
SAWDUST? MAYBE HE
WORKS IN A MEAT MARKET.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
WELL, WHERE THERE'S SAWDUST,
THERE'S USUALLY A SAWMILL.
AND I'LL BET THAT'S
WHERE WE'LL FIND
THOSE FOOTPRINTS CAME FROM.
WOW! THIS PLACE
LOOKS MORE LIKE A SCARE MILL
THAN A SAWMILL.
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN DESERTED
FOR AT LEAST 100 YEARS.
AND I'M FOR KEEPING IT DESERTED.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
SCOOBY: YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
NOT BEFORE WE GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THIS MYSTERY.
LET'S SPLIT UP AND
SEARCH THIS PLACE.
COME ON, YOU SCAREDY-CATS!
AAH!
OH, SCOOBY.
THAT'S JUST YOUR REFLECTION
IN A BROKEN MIRROR.
SCOOBY: HUH?
HEE HEE HEE!
BLBLBLBLBLBL!
MMM! MMM!
SCOOBY: VELMA!
YIKES!
SCOOBY: SHAGGY?
SCOOBY: VELMA? SHAGGY?
Velma: SCOOBY! HELP!
SCOOBY: VELMA!
SCOOBY: HUH?
QUICK, SCOOBY! CUT THE CHAINS!
GET A BIGGER SAW!
SCOOBY: UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
SCOOBY: YIKES!
HEE HEE HEE!
Velma: SCOOBY!
SCOOBY: UH-OH!
QUICK! MAKE LIKE A BEAVER!
SCOOBY: BEAVER?
SCOOBY: OH!
YOU DID IT, SCOOBY!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
AAH!
HELP! HELP! OH!
SCOOBY: HUH?
HEY! GIVE ME BACK MY GLASSES!
SCOOBY: YIKES! DYNAMITE!
DYNAMITE?
AND AFTER SCOOBY PICKED
THE LOCK ON THE CHAINS,
WE CAME RIGHT BACK HERE.
NOW ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS FIND SHAGGY.
IT'S SHAGGY!
HE'S BEEN TURNED INTO A
GHOST BY THE SNOW GHOST!
SCOOBY: SHAGGY!
SCOOBY: SHAGGY!
HEY! SHAGGY'S NOT
A GHOST ANYMORE!
I'M NOT?
Daphne: WHAT HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL I REMEMBER IS FAINTING
AT THE SIGHT OF MR. HARRY SCARY
AND WAKING UP AS A GOONEY GHOST.
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SPRAYED
WITH SOME WHITE STUFF,
AND THE WATER WASHED IT OFF.
WAIT A MINUTE!
IF THE SNOW GHOST DIDN'T REALLY
TURN YOU INTO A GHOST,
MAYBE HE'S NOT A GHOST, EITHER.
THEN HE MUST BE FOR REAL.
RUN, EVERYBODY!
SCOOBY: OOPS!
LIKE, THANKS A LOT.
SCOOBY: SORRY.
KEEP RUNNING! HE'S
RIGHT BEHIND US!
QUICK! DUCK BEHIND THOSE LOGS!
WELL, WE LOST HIM.
YEAH, BUT WE LOST DAPHNE, TOO.
I'M IN HERE.
HEY! A SECRET HOLLOW LOG!
THAT'S NOT ALL THAT'S IN HERE.
LOOK!
DIAMONDS AND JEWELRY!
BUT WHAT ARE THEY
DOING HIDDEN IN THAT LOG?
HMM. I THINK I'M
BEGINNING TO FIGURE OUT
THIS KOOKY DEEP-FREEZE MYSTERY.
WHILE YOU'RE PUTTING
TWO AND TWO TOGETHER,
WE BETTER FIND SHAGGY AND SCOOB.
AAH! AAH!
YOW! YOW!
ZOINKS! THAT CREEP
NEVER GIVES UP!
SCOOBY, THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE A BACKSEAT DRIVER.
AAH! AAH!
HURRY! TURN LEFT! TURN RIGHT!
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND US!
NOW HE'S IN FRONT OF US!
HEAD FOR THE ICE, SCOOBY!
SCOOBY: ICE? ICE!
"DAN...
"DAN... GER...
"DANGER!
THIN ICE!"
AAH! AAH!
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT?
WE'RE FROZEN LIKE
A COUPLE OF ICICLES,
BUT AT LEAST WE'RE SAFE
FROM THAT CREEPY SNOW GHOST.
BLBLBLBLBLBL!
HA HA HA!
HEE HEE HEE!
AAH! WE'RE ON A SKI JUMP!
QUICK! MAKE LIKE A BIRD!
LUCKY WE FOUND YOU TWO,
OR YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN STUCK
TILL THE SPRING THAW.
I'D RATHER BE STUCK HERE
THAN WITH THAT SNOW GHOST.
SPEAKING OF THAT
GOONEY SNOW GHOST,
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
CATCH HIM! THIS QUICK-FREEZE
WORKED ON SHAGGY AND SCOOBY.
MAYBE IT'LL WORK
ON HIM! COME ON!
SCOOBY: HUH?
YOU ALL SET, SCOOBY?
SCOOBY: YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
OK! WHEN WE LURE
THE GHOST PAST HERE,
YOU TAKE THE LID OFF THE BUCKET
AND DUMP THE WATER ON HIM.
Velma: THEN HE'LL FREEZE
INTO A BLOCK OF ICE.
SCOOBY: YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!
AND, LIKE, JUST TO MAKE
SURE YOU DON'T MISS,
HERE'S A COUPLE
OF SCOOBY SNACKS.
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
ZOINKS! IT'S THE SNOW GHOST!
Velma: AND HE'S TRYING
TO THROW SCOOBY OFF THE LEDGE!
I'LL SAVE YOU, SCOOB!
AAH! AAH!
BE CAREFUL! LOOK OUT! WATCH IT!
OHH! OHH!
MR. GREENWAY! MR. GREENWAY!
OHH! HAVE I GOT A HEADACHE!
I'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU KIDS.
YOU'VE UNCOVERED ONE
OF THE BIGGEST RINGS
OF JEWEL THIEVES IN THE COUNTRY.
THOSE TWO WERE THE
MASTERMINDS OF THE RING.
LEECH OVER HERE WOULD
BRING THE STOLEN JEWELS
TO GREENWAY IN A SUITCASE.
THEN GREENWAY WOULD SEND THEM
DOWN THE RIVER AND
ACROSS THE BORDER
HIDDEN IN THESE
HOLLOWED-OUT LOGS.
Daphne: TO SCARE PEOPLE AWAY,
HE DISGUISED HIMSELF
AS THE SNOW GHOST.
HE GOT THE IDEA WHEN FU LAN CHI
TOLD HIM THAT WILD STORY.
YEAH. HE EVEN MADE IT
LOOK LIKE HE COULD FLY.
HOW DID HE DO THAT?
TRANSPARENT PLASTIC SKIS.
THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
AT NIGHT. SHOW HIM, SCOOBY!
YAY! YAY!
YAY, SCOOBY!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO!
SCOOBY: SCOOBY DOO! HEE HEE HEE!
